24 May 2022

**Active/Storage** before 24 February 2022:
(MBT = Main Battle Tank)

- Active MBT: ~2800
  - ~2000 T-72B3
  - ~500 T-80
- Storage MBT: ~11000
  - 3000 T-80 being upgraded to T-80BVM
  - ~8000 old T-72 types (A, M etc)

**Losses** after 24 February 2022 to now:
(documented by Oryx) with my applied Upper Limits
 UL50 = +50% upper limit for non-detection/missed (1 in 2 detected)
 UL75 = +75% upper limit for non-detection/missed (1 in 4 detected)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Total: 700 = 25% of active (UL50 1150 = 41% of active / UL75 1225 = 44% of active)
- T-72X: 420 = 21% of active (UL50  630 = 32% of active / UL75  735 = 37% of active)
- T-80X: 133 = 27% of active (UL50  200 = 40% of active / UL75  233 = 47% of active)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Conclusions**

- Russ has lost confirmed 700 MBTs to date = 25% active (on paper);
- Given an operational ratio of 0.5 (1 in 2 tanks is functional,
  the other is in repairs) this means 50% effective losses
  (could be as high as 82-88%);
- Russ may have lost about 1100-1300 MBTs to date;

- Russ has lost 25% of all active T-72 all types (may be 40-45%);
- Russ has lost 27% of all active T-80 all types (may be 40-47%);
- Relative loss ratio about equal for T-72 and T-80:
  - most T-80s were deployed with 4th Guards Tank Division that took a heavy
    beating on the Sumy axis;
  - T-72B3 (most modern) 215 documented losses = 50% all T-72 lost; only normal
    since it is deployed everywhere;
  - T-80 has a higher overall loss ratio given it was deployed in fewer places;
- Russ has lost many more tanks than were initially given to West OSK (Russian
  West Command);
- Russ will have to resort to MBT reserves (very poor quality) very soon;
