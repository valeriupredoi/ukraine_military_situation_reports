Brief uodate for 16-17 April 2022
=================================

Russ continues to amass and group forces in the East, but has also started ground attacks in the Izyum-Rubizhne-Popasna triangle, as we have seen for a few days now. A little bit about the numbers involved:

- ISW estimates around 22 Battalion Tactical Groups (BTGs) around Izyum ie 15-22,000 troops (depending what size a BTG is now, previously it was 600-800, now the US DoD estimates it around 1,000)
- the Russ has redeployed the 35 and 36 Combined Arms Armies (CAAs) to the East (from N and NW of Kyiv - note, these are well battered and demoralized large units, so their will and capacity to fight a large-scale attack is limited)
- all-in-all the Russ is bringing in the East about 60 BTGs (60,000 troops) plus another 30 BTGs from Donetsk and Luhansk rebel militaries, overall force of about 95,000
- the Ukranians are known to have roughly 60,000 regulars in about 2/3 proportion and one third of Territorial Defense forces amassed and defending in the same area; note, however, that the actual Ukrainian force that can fight there is much larger - 300,000 if they move all their Territorial Defence forces from all over the country - they are probably not going to move them because those are mainly static forces, that need to be kept in and around cities, just in case

A little bit about the strategy of attack:

- the Russ has so far been attacking in limited strength, just as was the case before with the battles around Kyiv and on the Sumy axis: attacks around Rubizhne and Popasna have been repelled by the Ukrainians so far
- the Russ is facing solid active resistance from the Ukrainians while attacking on small scales (their columns spotted by drones that fix their position, and promptly attacked by artillery from fixed Ukrainian emplacements)
- it appears the Russ is attacking mainly on the Izyum-Slovyansk axis, with secondary efforts on Severodonetsk-Barvinkove-Kramatorsk axis
- if the Russ doesn't switch to large-scale attacks on multiple axes, chances are all their attacks are going to bog down, with the Ukrainians going on the counter-offensive once the Russ has been exhausted
- looking at the numbers, the state in which the Russ troops and their equipment is, and the fighting conditions (see below), even a number of large-scale offensives on multiple axes will quickly run out of steam if the Ukrainians defend well (and there is no reason why they wouldn't given their troops there are veterans, and have high morale) - the old thumb rule that an attacker should outnumber the defender on a 3 to 1 ratio still stands, since entrenched defense warfare is less costly than attack

And a little bit about the geographical, weather, and infrastructure conditions in the area:

- the geography of Eastern Ukraine favours very large scale tank and attached infantry attacks, as it happened in WW2; the Russ has not carried out such attacks not even once during this war: there are various analyses saying that they simply aren't capable of scaling up combined arms attacks, and the most they can do are attacks of a few BTGs; this remains to be seen, but in so far there have not been any signs to say the contrary
- weather is crap for the Russ too (great for Ukrainian defenders) - been raining, and will be raining the next week too, the firelds are very muddy and the movement islimited to roads; moving along roads limits the breadth of the attack and makes it predictable and vulnerable to artillery, Bayraktar, and highly mobile anti-tank platoons
- the specific geography of the area also means there are numerous small rivers and creeks that may or may not have bridges, so this is yet another obstacle against armoured advances
- there are a few large towns that the Russ will have to either take or risk bypassing - from the ordeal in Mariupol we can see the Russ has a lot of difficulty taking urban centres, and also, such attacks result in disastrous conditions for the civilians - at any rate - these will only slow down the Russ

So, that mighty Russ offensive CNN and BBC and other media outlets are on about might not even happen, just trickling its way two or three BTGs at a time. The Russ is still trying to put together units that have previously been smashed to pieces (see 35, 36 CAA, 4th Guards Tank Division that suffered very heavy losses on the Sumy axis, 1st and 2nd Guards Tank Armies that bogged down and got shredded East of Kyiv), while also bringing in some (emphasis on "some") reinforcements from elsewhere (e.g. troops that were supposed to rotate the ones in Syria have now been re-routed to Ukraine, Naval Infantry off the Sakhalin Island, Abkhazians - that actually just got smashed by the Ukrainians). Without a general mobilization and lengthy pause for reorganization the Russ will exhaust its small scale attacks, and the situation wil result in a stalemate again. This is what analysts may think of when they say the war will be very lengthy, personally I don't see it as a lengthy war but rather, a short war (probably 2-3 more weeks), followed by a long attrition or continuation war - absolutely pointless, and extremely costly.
