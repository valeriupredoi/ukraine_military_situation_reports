## General situation

- fires continue in Russia: a large explosion at a military base in the Far East has killed several
- the reported Russ losses (KIA)  according to Ukraine are in excess of 26,000 killed; Western intelligence and actual visual analysis confirms the Russ has lost more than 700 tanks, thousand+ of other military vehicles and doezens of aircraft; Russ' main problems are the huge casulaty rate and the drop in morale, military gear is now starting to become scare too -
- reports of Russ having well and truly run out of cruise missiles, and now relying more and more on obsolete ballistic missiles, and some antiquated Kh-22 Raduga cruise missiles (from the late 60s) - apparently the Ukrainians have been reporting mysterious explosions far away from any legitimate target - 1960s missiles with 3-4km precision


## Tactical situation

- Ukrainian counter-offensive around Kharkiv: fighting in N, NE Kharkiv, pushing the Russ even closer to the border; Kharkiv is reported to be fully outside Russ artillery range (of any kind); not a fast counter-offensive, but rather a coninual push, that will eventually kick all the Russ depleted BTGs over the border; Russ are destroying bridges as they flee, so it's an indication they are abandoning this axis for good;
- fighting in the Izyum-Rubizhne-Severodoentsk-Popasna cauldron: the Russ has attempted to cross the Sieversk Doents river towards Bilohorivka (a key point towards Lysychansk and encircling Severodonetsk); reports of at least four pontoon bridges a couple days ago; reports of all but one destroyed by today, other reports suggesting the Russ has managed to cross in relative strength towards Bilohorivka - there is heavy shelling and fighting all along the Sieversk river from Izyum to Rubizhne (which is still contested); no visible progress from the Russ, but continual pressure applied on the Ukrainian defenders;
- Russ is reportedly attempting a push Westwards from Popasna to Bakhmut to try secure the M03 highway to Slovyansk - not making much sense since they'd overstretch their lines of communication, and a push South from Izyum seems impossible at the moment, with the Izyum side of the front being weakened through sending units to shore the Ukrainian counteroffensive around Kharkiv; in the same vein the Russ is attacking directly due West of Izyum - puzzling;
- reports of a Ukrainian counter-attack 40km North of Izyum, attempting to cut off the Russ around Izyum - this may explain the Russ attacking due West, trying to get themselves in a maneouver outside the Ukrainian pincer (if any at all)
- Mariupol's Azovstal factory is still held by the now heavily battered Azov and Marines; reports indicate that NOT all the civilians have been evacuated; the Ukrainians (military - about 1000, but with a high proportion of wounded,and with the two hospitals there destroyed by the Russ, their situation is dire - and civilians if any left) are out of options, but continue to resist!
