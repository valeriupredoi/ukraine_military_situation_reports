## Russia: staggering numbers of veterans (and war casulaties)

There is no way for Putin but to continue the war. If he stopped now, and demobilized
the army, he'd be faced with: an economy in ruins, almsot 700,000 veterans that were casulaties of war,
plus another 700,000 veterans that'd be demobilized now - this is a staggering number of disilusioned
ex-combatants, that will suffer from - psychological/psychiatric effects from the war, poverty, a sense that
all their suffering was for nothing - in effect, the Afghan Syndrome. State organs are already setting up
veterans' centers to steer all these veterans towards a regime-controlled path, but this is a long haul effort.
