Since February 9-10 it appears as, or at least, military analysts are saying that the Russian army has regained initiative and started the "spring offensive". This is a limited offensive by the looks of it, and is already facing stalling. There is no significant progress noticed on any of the main axes of offesnive: Kreminna-Svatove, Bakhmut, and south via Vuhledar. The Russian army - Marines, more precisely (155th and 40th Naval Infantry Battalions) suffered horrendous losses when attacking Vuhledar two weeks ago (up to the combined loss of an entire battalion, dozens of tanks and infantry fighting vehicles, see https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-russia-battle-vuhledar/32276547.html - this is not new e.g last year in May the Russians lost an entire battalion tactical group trying to cross the Siverski-Donetsk river, but it is interesting to see this being repeated again, in light of so-called major changes in the Russian military). The situation in Bakhmut is now stabilized, as it was in a fairly dangerous position last week - the south of the city and the surroundings are firmly secured; moreover, due to serious friction between the Private Military Company "Wagner", and its leader Prigozshin, with the regular Russian military (VSRF), Wagner has now been ordered to retreat, and all its supplies have been cut completely as of yesterday. It appears that they have indeed retreated. The Kreminna-Svatove line is now secure as well, with the Ukrainians holding the main supply route (MSR) there; moreover, it appears that the Russian airborne troops (VDV) fighting there suffered significant losses, with a large number of officers' obituaries being published on Russian social media; speaking of losses, the UK MoD has published its estimate for Russian losses so far, in almost 12 months of war: 200,000 losses (dead, wounded, and captured) - this means the entire 100k that Russia started with plusanother 100k out of the 250k hastily recruited in September-November last year, and such a very hich number is supported by the Russian tactics of throwing bodies at Ukrainians until they run out of ammunution - which is actually happening right now - the Ukrainians being very low on artillery shells along all the front lines.
