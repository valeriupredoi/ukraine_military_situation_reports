Short recap
===========

It is the 18th day of the 3-day long "special operation" and all is going according to Putin's plan:

- Russ forces fully deployed, having sustained heavy losses: according to the Ukrainian Command, 31 Russ BTGs (Battalion Tactical Groups, each of 600-800 men) out of 117 have been either completely destroyed or rendered temporarily disabled/inactive. If only half this number is indeed true that would mean an entire Russ division has been destroyed in less than three weeks; the Russ is clearly looking to plug massive troops gaps since is now looking at Belarus to join the fight (many desertions in the Bielorussian army, a general unwillingness to fight), and at paramilitary and external forces to join, convicted criminals from Russia, and forces from Abkhazia and South Ossetia are apparently being rallied up;
- Russ continues to attack but the way each attack is done is against any tactical odds: small scale attacks (2-3 BTGs at a time), uncoordinated, and at times, taking heavy losses;
- Russ' communication and supply lines are often attacked by the Ukrainians, them having to divert forces that could be used in an attack, to defend said lines;
- Russ is using a great deal of their forces to keep Ukrainian cities encircled (and continually shelled), even though Ukrainian defenses are solid, Russ probing attempts at taking these cities are met with fierce resistance and counter-attacks, and more Russ losses;
- (follow-up 1) Russ will need to concentrate a lot more forces to actually take this cities; if they don't, and simply bypass them, they risk exposing the rear of their lines to Ukrainian counter-attacks from these posckets; so they just sit outside and fire their artillery instead;
- (follow-up 2) Heavy fighting for the peripheral towns around bigger ctities usually results in Russ minor gains, that are nulled when the Ukrainians counter-attack and retake these settlements;
- Russ is losing generals and high ranking officers: the assumed explanation is that they move closer to the front lines to personally conduct operations due to lack of initiative and low morale from the lower ranks; also unsecured communication channels e.g. mobile phones, which are triangulated; Russ losing high ranking officers may be a beneficial thing for them given the utter incompetence they showed so far;
- The Ukrainian military has sustained heavy losses too (declared 1,300 personnel dead on March 12, clearly a larger number in reality) but continues to pursue a highly successful "active defense" strategy (defend a Russ attack, then counter-attack);
- The Ukrainian Air Force is still very active (and the Russ is indirectly proving this by attacking air bases and aviation fuel dumps);
- It is possible that the Ukrainians will conduct a major counter-offensive on multiple fronts, that will break this stalemate, and give them very favourable terms during peace negotiations; they might be waiting for the spring muds (Rasputitsa), and/or for the Russ to fully grind down, especially around Kyiv. One hopes...
