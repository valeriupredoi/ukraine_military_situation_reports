Analysis: why 2023 is as important, and fundamentally tide-changing a year, for both Ukraine and Russia, just as 1942 was for both Germany and the Soviet Union? The current situation in Ukraine may resemble, at a much smaller scale (maybe 1 to 10 scale, given both troop numbers and size of front lines), to that of the Eastern Front in 1941-42; actually, it is a very good replica of the Southern Axis of the Eastern front, axis that was, as it is today, stretching over Ukraine. Ukraine plays pretty much the role of Germany (from a tactical point of view, no resemblance whatsoever to regimes, ideology etc, of course) - Ukraine obtained masterful victories during 2022, not just with tactical value, but with wide strategic value too, but ultimately, ground to a halt due in part to the need to replenish the losses that those victories came with, rearm, and retrain. Ukraine is in a very good position now - having reassembled a lot of units, rearmed them with new weapons (we'll get to the present need of tanks), and holding numerical advantage over Russia - just as Germany had in the spring of 1942, on the back of the infamous drive to Moscow in the winter of 1941 - but from a strategic point of view, the actual problem Germany had was the attritional losses they suffered all through the brilliant campaign in the summer and fall of 1941 (the first phase of Operation Barbarossa), followed by an attritional war later in 1941; they, just as the Ukrainians, took the time in the winter of 1941, and start of 1942 to prepare for the spring offensive (Fall Blau/Case Blue - the first and biggest resoyrces-oriented offensive in the East, the Germans aiming to capture the oil fields of the Caucasus). Ukraine, now, just as Germany in the spring of 1942, is poised to launch a large counter-offensive; here's how the two situations resemble further, and how they'll start to diverge, depending on modern circumstances vs historical events:

Things Germany had to do in 1942, and Ukraine should too, in 2023: gain the initiative by attacking, so that the enemy doesn't have time to mobilize more forces and revamp their defense industrial complex; Germany chose to attack first, in June, and the offensive was highly successful up to a point (which geographically is called Stalingrad, but strategically it's called the point where the Red Army was powerful, correctly led, and just enough supplied to seize the initiative); in 2023 it is more than likely that Russia will attack first (sometime in February-March) - Ukraine must, under all circumstances, hold and use the attack to blunt the Russian momentum, only for themselves to go on the counter-attack in April-May. Just as germy had to do in 1942, Ukraine must achieve a crushing victory in their counter-offensive (a war-winning offensive, as military historians call), so that, even if a cease-fire is signed after this, Russia will be unable to rearm and mobilize again, for a few years. germany failed in this objective for reasons I'll not analyze, but one: tanks. By mid-1942 the German army was suffering from massive shortages of useful tanks - things changed drastically when the Russians started fielding the superb T-34 tank in large numbers, with Germany losing a high percentage of their previous speed of maneouver (even if they had a decent number of tanks, they were light and ineffective versus the Russian tanks). Their speed of maneouver was badly hindered by the lack of powerful tanks, supported by armoured infantry - the lack of armoured troop carriers was as bad as the lack of suitable tanks. The Germans barely had mechanized - trucks, that is - infantry, let alone armoured - using armoured personnel carriers, or in modern times, infantry fighting vehicles - infantry. The way war was waged then is not much more different than now (of course, in broad lines, and given that, just as then, aviation is now just a tactical arm, supporting the ground warfare, as both Ukraine and Russia are using it), so you now understand why the Ukrainians are asking for tanks, and armoured infantry vehicles - to pursue a fast, maneouvre warfare that achives tactical objectives in the shortest time possible.

Just as then when Germany had to obtain a crushing victory in a short time, Ukraine needs to do the same now - attritional warfare or even worse, a mockery of a cease fire, favours Russia completely - their worst enemy, after democracy, is fast, decisive warfare on short timescales - given enough of time, as it would be in the case of a prolongued conflict, they can mobilize, and reorganize their military manufacturing complex, just as the Soviets did almost immediately after the German attack in June 1941 - by late 1942 the Soviets were ready to seize the initiative, and by mid-1943 they were the dominant force in the East.

A quick look at the machines then and now: back in 1942 the Germans had to mass-produce the superb Sturmgeschutz III (Assault Gun III) - a simple, reliable, rugged, mobile (enough) gun platform that could outmatch any tank the Soviets had, and could be mass-produced, easily maintained, and benefitted from lots of standardization for spare parts. What'd they do instead? They invested loads of money and production time in super-complex heavy tanks, unreliable and hard to maintain monsters like the Tiger I. Numbers have it: 1,300 Tiger I tanks produced in total, over 10,000 Stugs produced (and still, by far not enough). German tanks in 1942 were a logistical nightmare due to lack of standardization and multiple breakages of such overly complex machines like the Tiger.
It's a bit scary now to see that the Ukrainians are somewhat following the German path in terms of overly complex logistical chains - for different reasons, of course: rather than a self-inflicted situation as it was for the Germans in 1942, the Ukrainians really need all manners of hardware. The effects are the same though - detrimental towards fast logistical support during a fast-paced offensive (I hope I am wrong, and by spring all things logistics will be rolling faster than the actual Leopard tanks they're getting). As for the new tanks - and am going to talk Leopards, since this is the type Ukraine will probably get in numbers, and sooner than the Abrams - the Leopard (2Ax, they seem to be getting 2A4 or PL from Poland, 2A5 from Spain and Netherlans and 2A6 from Germany) is exactly what the Tiger wasn't - it combines all the lessons the Germans learned during WW2 - it is a superb machine: fast/mobile, well-protected, with a very heavy punch, and above all - reliable, easy to maintain and repair, with a high degree of standardization for parts and ammunition, and in large numbers (across Europe, and hopefully in Ukrainian service).
