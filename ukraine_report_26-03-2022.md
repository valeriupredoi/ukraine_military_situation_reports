Frontlines situation 26 March 2022
==================================

**Russ Operational axes:**

- (main) Kyiv (West) -> Ukrainian counter-offensive:
  - Ukrainian counter-attacks along the E40 highway at Makariv, Irpin (most of it retaken), Bucha and Hostomel; Russ retreating, and digging in
- (main) Kyiv (East) -> Ukrainian counter-offensive:
  - Ukrainian counterattacks along the Kyiv-Brovary axis, they retake Brovary
  - Ukrainian counterattacks in the area of Lukyanivka, retaking it 
- (directly supporting) Kharkiv:
  - Kharkiv still well in Ukrainian control, in SE - Izyum (focal point) still in Ukrainian hands; active defending (counter-attacks) all around Chernihiv, harassing attacks on Russin rears and supply lines
- (supporting) Luhansk: on LOC Russ slowly pushing, no notable advance
- (supporting) Mariupol and the right (East) spearhead from Crimea (target: linkup with Donetsk/Luhansk):
  - slow Russ progress in Mariupol (they are in the city centre); costly urban warfare
- (supporting) Mykolayiv and the left spearhead (West) from Crimea (target: Odessa, westward advance):
  - Kherson region is very unstable for the Russ (they brought in an engineer battalion to shore up the line); south of Mykolaiv - Ukrainians are pushing through; VKS airstrikes on their own columns (friendly fire); 49 CAA commanding officer KIA
  - Odessa safer by the day (with the Russ not being able to move West, even more, being pushed back; amphibious ship blown up at Berdyansk port)


**General situation:**

The tactical situation and initiative is currently turning in the favour of the Ukrainian military in a few places: they are conducting counter-offensives West and East of Kyiv, and holding active defending in the NE and East along the Sumy axis and Kharkiv, Izyum is now a focal point of the Russ offensive in East, currently held by the Ukrainians, and checking its Southern tip. The Ukrainians are also very active in the South - in the Mykolaiv and Kherson regions - the Russ front at Kherson is very unstable (they had to bring in an engineers battalion shore up the frontline, it is very possible that the Ukrainians will be attempting at retaking Kherson in the next days).

The Ukrainians are conducting counter-offensives made up of numerous fast, mobile, counter-attacks, followed by tactical retreats; these types of maneouvres don't result in retaking large swathes of land, but rather, in taking key points, and more importantly, in destroying a large quantity of Russ troops and equipment, in the process creating disarray during their own retreating.

The Russ High Command has announced that the sole campaign objective has always been the full "liberation" of Donetsk and Luhansk Eastern provinces - which is total bull since a couple weeks ago they were hinting that Ukrainian territory East of the Don river was the objective, and a month ago the objective seemed to be the entire country. They also announced the first figures for dead and wonded Russ soldiers for the first time after March 2nd (then - about 500 dead; now - about 1,350 dead) - absolute bull figures since the ferocity of the fighting was such that Western estimates are at 7,000-10,000 Russ soldiers dead, with Ukrainian (most definitely inflated) placing the number at 15,000 dead Russ.

Anyways, the Russ is now regrouping through unit consolidation ie assembling new full-sized units from fragments of well-battered battallions; they are trying to replenish the lost equipment (which was lost in very large amounts: one estimate says the Ukrainians captured more Russ tanks than they actually lost in battles, so now they have more tanks than they started the war with - the first such case in moden warfare, probably equalled only by Erwin Rommel's capturing of British equipment in the North African desert in WW2). It is, however, clear by now that the Russ does not have the needed troops to continue sustained offensives on more than on side of the fronts, even though, despite this, and despite Moscow's allegations about DNR and LNR being the only campaign objectives, they will continue to keep the encirclement and shell Ukrainian cities - until the Ukrainians manage to break these encirclements, and dig in.

Quick note about Ukrainian weapons deliveries: they keep getting them from the West, and they are also getting heavy weaponry (not many details on that, and it should stay this way); they are also getting new Bayraktar TB2 combat drones from Turkey (again, not many details how - it seems via air transports). The fact that the Russ has attacked its own columns in the South (destroying an entire column, confirmed by Russ over-the-air communication) and that they are throwing in even tank prototypes (see the T-80UM2 "Black Eagle" next-gen tank prototype destroyed a few days ago, and the BMPT-72 Terminator - of which only a few have been built - getting shipped to the frontline) is showing the Russ, despite its large quantities of hardware, is getting well pressed and desperate. BTW estimates say that the Russ has fired about 1,200 ballistic and cruise missiles already (mostly at civilian targets) - that is about 50% of all their missiles in Russland!

Things to watch for in the next days: hopefully the Ukrainian counter-offensives will pick up even more momentum, and they will manage to free more towns; the Izyum focal point and the attempt of the Russ to push for an encirclement of the Ukrainian troops on the LOC (Line of Contact) in the East bordering Luhansk and Donetsk; possible intensified and altered to more ugly weapons Russ bombardment of civilians (they have already used phosphorous bombs in Kharkiv two days ago).
