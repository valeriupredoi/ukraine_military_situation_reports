Overall news: it appears that the Russ is keen to dig in the South (around Kherson Oblast and Zaporizhyia) and will probably start the process to include that territory into Russia itself; the Russ has announced that the massive nuclear power station in Enerhodar City (Zaporizhiya nuclear plant) will be used to send electricity to Russia, and will "sell a fraction of it" to Ukraine - this is both good and bad news: good news since the Russ has finally conceded that there will be a Ukraine after all this disaster is over with, and bad news since the powerplant is massive (largest in Europe) and Ukraine is losing about 20% of power from not using it.

In other news, the UK MoD reports that Putin and Gerasimov are now in control of the strategy, and worse, the tactical planning too - very good news in fact, since they're both incompetent (Putin is not even military); so expect things will not get better for the Russ army!

On the tactical front: the Ukrainians have pushed Eastward over Siverski Donets river, North-East of Kharkiv, they reached the international border with Russia at several points - the main push is towards Vovchansk (see blue arrow on map) - that place is the road node where the Russ ground lines of communication (GLOCs) pass through from their main rallying+supply point (Belgorod, Russia) towards Izyum and the Donetsk front; securing that place (which the Ukrainians are in the process of) will cut the shorter lines, and make the Russ use longer and more exposed supply lines.

In the Donbass - the Russ has now shifted its centre of mass for attacks to Popasna, with a secondary objective being Lyman, they are trying to get full access of the M-03 highway and cut off the Ukrainians East of it; so far things have been slow as we've come to expect from the Russ - heavy artillery and air attacks, but relatively little troop movement and advancing; the Ukrainians are putting pressure on the Russ West of Izyum, and are well entrenched South and South-East of it, but losing M-03 highway would be a relatively major blow since that would allow the Russ to move directly West to Bakhmut, and would cut off the Lysychansk/Severodonetsk hotspot. If Putin is in charge, expect things will not work out for the Russ, at this speed of developments we'll only see where this is going in a week or so!
