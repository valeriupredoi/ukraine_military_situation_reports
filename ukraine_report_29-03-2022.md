Brief operational update 29 March 2022
======================================

The Russ just said they will drastically reduce the offensive effort around Kyiv and Chernihiv - and, as good as this may sound, I reckon it's a means of buying time - they have started withdrawing a lot of forces from NW and NE Kyiv all the way along the H-07 highway to Sumy and Konotop, but this is not because they will reduce their offesnive efforts, but rather beacuse they badly need to regroup and consolidate these forces:

- 1st and 2nd Guards Tank Armies (or, Guards Combined Arms Armies) have been pulling back at a pace that the Ukrainians can't really follow, so that they can't hit them while retreating; the Russ has been destroying bridges in the process too. This is bad for both the Ukrainians - they can't rout the Russ at speed with no bridges, but also bad for the Russ - if they resume the offensive, it's not going to be easy without bridges.
- The Ukrainians have retaken Irpin (NW of Kyiv) and also are pushing (or, following the retreating Russ) in direction due East of Kyiv, past Brovary; it appears that the H-07 highway is now Russ-free, and the Ukrainians are roaming freely in the (retreating) Russ rears from Sumy to Konotop; indeed, starting 27-28 March, Sumy is not shelled by the Russ anymore, for the first time in a month;
- The Russ is attempting to reconstitute battalion-sized formations with troops from the Far East (Pacific Fleet marines) and with reserves from the Baltic and South Ossetia and Dagestan - this is short of scraping the barrel, and it's very possible they will need a lengthy break before they have rebuilt some of their battle order; new VDV (Paratroops) units have been spotted too - but if they use them as they have so far, those guys won't live past Easter;
- In the meantime, troops pulled back to Belarus are facing issues frm Bielorussian saboteurs - at least two Russ trains full of equipment have been derailed, and Bielorussion railway workers have sabotaged the rail heads close to the Ukrainian border, those guys deserve medals for bravery!
- Izyum is a mess - it is possible that by now the Ukrainian 92nd Mechanized has gotten rid of the elements of Russ 2nd GTA - probably retreating to Russia? Not much is known about the situation there though;
- Mariupol is still being battered by both street fighting (although it appears the Russ has not gained much in the last 24-48h) and by constant Russ bombardment; Mariupol could be used by the Russ as an example for how costly the process of taking a Ukrainian city by direct infantry attack is, and they may rethink the way they'd go about other cities - if we were to believe the nonesense about them minimizing offensive operations, one would say Mariupol IS the only city they will take, since...
- Kherson is a powder keg - regular Ukrainian infantry is now inflitrating in the civilian protesters, and keeping Rosgvardia really busy, now forced to do both anti-insurgency and anti-partisan operations, plus added filtering to figure out which ones are Ukrainian regular army; keep it up, boys, show the Russ whose Kherson really is! BTW with all this happening in Kherson, no way jose they Russ can even think of moving due West to Odessa - probably that's why BBC is busy reporting cafes and restaurants have now reopened there;

A quick note on what the Ukrainians are missing badly at this very moment: they are missing offesnive wepon systems (aircraft, armour, and above all attack helicopters) - they really have a chance to go on the offesnive on a larger scale, and actually rout the Russ retreating. I think they are also not trained in offesnive operations on large scales, but what a pity - they could have brought a lot of chips to that sharade of a peace negotiations table!
