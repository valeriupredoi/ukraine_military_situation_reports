Frontlines situation 8 March 2022
=================================

**Russ Operational axes:**

- (main) Kyiv: Russ concentration on Irpin and Brovary; encirclement still not at all possible
- (directly supporting) Kharkiv: attempts at encirclement defeated by Ukraine military
- (supporting) Luhansk: messy, almost to none Russ advance plus an Ukrainian counter-attack
- (supporting) Mariupol and the right (East) spearhead from Crimea (target: linkup with Donetsk/Luhansk):
  stable: Mariupol encircled and still heavily shelled, Russ push to consolidate positions around the city
- (supporting) Mykolayiv and the left spearhead (West) from Crimea (target: Odessa, westward advance):
  second attempt at taking failed the previous day, Russ shelling heavily the city and attempting at bypassing it;
  uncoordinated effort to spearhead to Zaporizhyia, Russ doesn't have enough strength to attempt a concerted attack though;
  outskirts of Odessa coming under missile attack, but an amphibious landing is still less probable due to the Russ
  needing to coordinate with attacks via land from NE, which are not currently possible
- Overall: Russ very slow progress, doubled up by continious brutal attacks over civilian areas (all types of
  artillery (anything up to 200mm, MLRS) and cruise (Kalibr) and heavy ballistic missiles (Iskander))


**General situation:**

The Ukrainian army, no doubt provided with excellent NATO intelligence, is continuing to check most of
the Russ lumbering attacks on all fronts, destroying multiple ammunition and fuel dumps, and harassing
the flanks of the invader. It is the Russ logistics/supply lines they are targeting, and the more the Russ
advances, the longer these lines are, hence more vulnerable. The Ukrainian army is inflicting very heavy losses (e.g.
just yesterday they destroyed 50% of a Russ brigade NW of Kharkiv, with reports that entire Russ batallions
get completely destroyed). Although this may seem completely unacceptable losses from a Western/NATO point of
view, the Russian/ex-Soviet approach to them is completely different - for them (the Russ General Staff), a strategic
objective is of the utmost importance, and tactical losses are compensated for by injecting more troops (with degraded quality, as first line batallions get wiped out); just as an example,
the Red Army won the Battle of Berlin in May 1945, but in the two weeks the battle lasted, they lost 80,000 troops with about 200,000 wounded. When they start the siege of Kyiv losses on the Russ side will ramp up, if they decide to go and fight street by street; they will most probably not do that (lessons learned from Groznyi, more recently) so the prospect of a siege, and
an absolutely horrendous bombardment (probably including strategic bombers) is more accurate. Ukrainians will, no doubt, use
lessons learnt from previous sieges, and hopefully will be able to mount a decisive counter-attack, on the scale the Soviets
conducted during the Battle of Stalingrad. Strength to the Ukrainian defenders!
