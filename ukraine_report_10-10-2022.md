In light of today's missile attacks on Ukrainian civilian centers, here are a few points we should consider and see why these happened: Putin is clearly, and openly taking the tit-for-tat approach; this is, however, a simplistic way to portray these "retaliatory"! attacks, the substrate is far more complex, and the clues are in the situation in Russia itself:

- there are two more and more distant camps in Moscow and Kremlin: the hardliners, that fully support the war in Ukraine and its ludicrous message (de-nazification etc.), and that are wanting to see an escalation of the current military situation; these hardliners are voiced by milbloggers and TV personae, that are crusading online and in the media; on the other hand, there are the moderates, including, and not only, the state security and intelligence and counter-intelligence services (the FSB), some military top brass, and some of the media; of course, both these camps appear to be supporting Putin, at least on the surface, but, in reality, both these camps are growing ever more disappointed with how Putin is handling the whole Ukraine situation (the hardliners - the hawks - have been deeply annoyed by how the sinking of the Moskva was handled - by brushing the whole affair under the carpet, or how the military situation on the frontline is handled - by lack of initiative and strength, remember the bridgehead over the Siversky Donets that was obliterated with the loss of at least one battalion tactical group back in May?, also the massive prisoner exchange from a few weeks ago); on the other hand, the moderates are growing disenchanted with the war itself, not necessarily since they've just found some pity for the Ukrainians, but rather, since they are seeing the effects of the war on the economy and their own fortunes;
- Putin is playing a balancing act at the moment: he needs to keep the hawks happy - the hawks represent his biggest threat, while constantly checking on the moderates, that are far less dangerous at the moment, simply because they don't have a platform - the hawks have a solid and effective platform - obliterate Ukraine and the West. Indeed, the hawks have switched to fully identifying Ukraine and the West (NATO etc) as one single enemy;
- So today he acted for the hawks, while not upsetting the moderates: he could have ordered aerial bombings (by tactical and strategic bombers), this would have been far more destructive for the Ukrainians - just as Aleppo was razed to the ground, and later on Mariupol, but here's why he didn't do this: the Ukrainian air defenses are more advanced with every day that passes (don't believe the media saying the West didn't pump in enough antia-aircraft systems) - they are operating an advanced umbrella, with direct input from NATO states - large bomber formations taking off from airfields in Russia are easily detectable, their course plotted in no time, and the Ukrainian air defenses deployed while they're still over Russia; Putin would have risked even more massive losses, this time around in very expensive pilots too; Syria had no such air defenses, so they could roam free. Such losses would have incensed the hawks;
- He (Putin) has also done something else two days ago - he changed the commander in chief of the Russian forces in Ukraine, appointing Gen. Surovikin in the role; this, again, made the hawks very happy, since the guy, albeit a bog-standard general of the General Staff, is perceived to be ruthless (again, with a CV full of Syria); this is again a very poor choice for Putin - possibly just to shift the blame again - since experience from the very limited campaign in Syria helps little during the massive Ukrainian campaign;

Putin's fall out with his own General Staff, a lot of the field generals, and with the security and intelligence services gives him no option but to stick to the hawks as much as he can, while pitting the hawks against all others, to keep everyone busy while he's still holding on to power. Purges will follow (seems Gerasimov and Shoigu will go soon), but these purges will only deepen the rift. This is a very dangerous dynamic, and one that may result in a coup, with disastruous consequences for the world - imagine some time around 1944, when Hitl and his inner circle of harcore Nazis were clearly distanced from the Wehrmacht (the army) and Abwehr (the intellgence service), but with nuclear weapons in the inventory of the SS.
