Frontlines situation 6 March 2022
=================================

**Russ Operational axes:**

- (main) Kyiv
- (directly supporting) Kharkiv
- (supporting) Luhansk
- (supporting) Mariupol and the right (East) spearhead from Crimea (target: linkup with Donetsk/Luhansk)
- (supporting) Mykolayiv and the left spearhead (West) from Crimea (target: Odessa, westward advance)


**General situation:**

- the Russ military is still trying to advance and encircle Kiyv with relatively good progress of the NE advance from the Sumy axis - this is due mainly to flat terrain in that area, the advance will slow down once densely populated areas will be reached at the outskirts of Kiyv - this is is now considered a probing attack that has had little effect (6 March)
- three-pronged advances in the South - uncoordinated but with Kherson occupied, the Russ can now divert forces towards Mykolaiyv - an important port and shipbuilding center
- the Russ is currently shelling heavily Mariupol, and, despite an agreed ceasefire that had to be observed today in order to allow evacuation of about 9,000 civilians, the Russ continues to shell the city mercilessly and is not observing the agreed ceasefire. The bombardment of Mariupol is brutal, and achieves absolutely no military goal because by now the city can be bypassed - it is purely to break the Ukrainian military morale
- it is likely that Odessa will be the next target in the South, a wonderful city full of historical architecture, and rich Russian history, hoping from the bottom of my heart the Russ will not reduce it to rubble. Russ Marines are poised to land at Odessa, which will be a bloody operation since the beaches are protected by anti-tank obstacles (hedgehogs) and the waters are mined (allegedly, there was an attempt at a landing on Feb 24, which was cancelled due to the Russ Marines' start of a mutiny)
- the Ukrainian Air Force keeps operating and inflicting losses (the Turkish Bayraktar TB-2 fighting drone is by now reaching legendary status)
- the Russ is still blocked in around Kharkiv (albeit they are shelling it heavily), in the Sumy area, Cernihiv, and of course NW Kiyv (Hostomel air base still in Ukrainian hands)
- the Russ by now lost at least three very high ranking commanders (including a commander of a CAA - Combined Arms Army, the largest mailitary unit in the Russian Army) and continues to suffer massive logistical issues. One reason why the Russ is losing high ranking commanders is that they are personally moving towards the front lines to rally up the troops - morale is low - so they get offed by snipers (not a military term, but a pleasure to use in this context)
