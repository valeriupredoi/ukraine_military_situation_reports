Brief update for Ukraine 29 April 2022
======================================

It is by now clear that the Russ is considering as well the Izyum-Rubizhna-Popasna traingle, and specifically the SE of Izyum as key point (centre of mass) where to attack towards Sklovyansk and Bravinkove, to allow for a choice of advance in the hope of encirling the Ukranian defenses from the N of the Donbass front. Apparently Valery Gerasimov, the Chief of the General Staff of the RFA (Russ Federation Army) has personally assumed command of the troops S of Izyum, plus they deployed the 76th VDV Division (paratroopers, probably the best army unit of the RFA) there too. The problem is that this happened too late, after plenty of time for the Ukrainians to organize their defenses there, and consequently, the Russ attacks of 27-29 April were stopped, with heavy Russ losses.

Tom Cooper in his posts (which I highly recommend https://medium.com/@x_TomCooper_x/ukraine-war-27-28-april-2022-ceb56f742e3) mentions that there was an old Soviet infantry tactics manual saying that it is not advised for an attacking force to do so on a wide line, spreading their assets thin, but to focus on a centre of mass point and attack decisively there, and move on from there - this is exactly NOT what the Russ are doing: they use a lot of artillery (that is poorly coordinated with ground troops movement, and don't use forward controllers - they just pound and hope for the best), 2-3 BTGs attack one target here, 2-3 BTGs attack another target there etc. No wonder the Ukrainian defenders, albeit starting to feel the exhaustion, are able to block up to 12 such attacks daily!

The Ukrainians have counterattacked in NE of Kharkiv, and in the Kherson Oblast - neither of these counterattacks hold the premise of a large scale counteroffensive, but they may force to Russ to redeploy troops off the Izyum axis, which is currently of major importance. The Ukrainians also remain very active in defending the air - another Mi-28N helo got downed in the Izyum area, and constantly harass the VKS (Russ aviation) now flying at higher altitudes to avoid being shot down (even attack helos are now adopting what's called "spray and pray" - tossing a load of unguided munition from a prone angle at higher altitudes, the moment they get closer to the ground, they promptly get shot down). Tom Cooper and others are also reporting that (despite previous attempts by the Russ to disrupt the rail system), transports of Western-given heavy weapons are currently arriving and being deployed by the Ukrainians (no analysit gives any details about these transport, and rightly so).

In the meantime, crazy fires keep being started in Russia - the latest being a coal powerplant in Sakhalin burning fiercely, with huge material loss - surely not a Ukrainian drone given it's all the way in Sakhalin! And on the same weird side of things - Transnistria is still being bullied to join the war with further attacks happening there. Apparently the Russ battalions there are being mobilized, exactly do what is unclear just yet.
