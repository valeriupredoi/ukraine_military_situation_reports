Frontlines situation 9 March 2022
=================================

**Russ Operational axes:**

- (main) Kyiv: Russ concentration on Irpin and Brovary; encirclement still not at all possible
- (directly supporting) Kharkiv: no activity; Sumy: push to encircle but checked by Ukrainian defenders
- (supporting) Luhansk: no Russ advance plus an Ukrainian counter-attack
- (supporting) Mariupol and the right (East) spearhead from Crimea (target: linkup with Donetsk/Luhansk):
  stable: Mariupol encircled and still heavily shelled, Russ push back for control of highway; spearhead
  to Zaporizhiya, one (!!) Russ BTG, pushed back by Ukrainians
- (supporting) Mykolayiv and the left spearhead (West) from Crimea (target: Odessa, westward advance):
  Russ shelling heavily the city and still attempting at bypassing it
- Overall: small gains in the NW Kyiv (Irpin) - Russ conducting a siege-and-starve strategy there,
  no notable gains elsewhere


**General situation:**

The Russ continues to consolidate positions around NW of Kyiv, and in the process gaining minimal territory around Irpin,
which is subjected to siege-and-starve tactics. The attack from the E-NE of Kyiv is still hampered by extended supply and
communication lines and constant attack on flanks by the Ukrainian defenders (1st, 2nd Guards Tank Armies slowly reaching the outskirts of Kyiv, 4th Guards Tank Division (elite) lost somewhere en route). The Russ command is assembling troops for the offensive on Kyiv, with reports that the Chechens are deployed in the area, and also moving in paramilitary brigades (the Liga, ex-Wagner Paramilitary Division) and Rosgvardia - the Russian National Guard, which is not part of the Russian Army, but rather, an internal defense army, much like the US National Guard, not meant to execute military operations elsewhere but inside the Russian borders, and with very limited combat experience. In the same vein, Syrian fighters are being asked to join the offensive on Kyiv, most probably to conduct urban offensive operations (currently unclear if they have or will join). This shows the Russ command is fast running out of actual battlefield units and pressing into combat units that are not meant for such operations; also, Russia is in a de-facto general mobilization since military contacts are now forbidden to be terminated. The Russ is still assembling this hodge-podge of units around Kyiv, and still conducting limited operations elsewhere, supporting this main effort. But if they keep going on the offensive on a limited scale (eg using a single Batallion Tactical Group to spearhead towards Zaporizhyia, attack easily checked by the Ukrainians), they will acheive very little.

Russ operations are still being hampered by Ukrainian flanking attacks and disruption of their (slowly extending) supply lines. It is important to realize that the Russ troop movement is restricted to roads, and in Ukraine most roads run in East-West direction, with much fewer roads running North-South, and even if areas on maps are shown as being under Russ control, those are mostly limited to the roads passing through those areas, with Ukrainian military still controlling the area between the roads, and conducting harassment attacks on Russ convoys. This is why the Russ is now using gunship helicopers as top cover of their transport and armoured convoys. This tactic (also used by the US military in Iraq) limits the effectiveness of the gunship helicopers, whose main mission should be to seek and destroy Ukrainian armour. Not to mention that flying low, they are excellent targets for the Ukrainian Stinger and Piorun-armed defenders!
