Brief update 30 Apr 2022
========================

- the Russ offesnive South of Izyum has completely stalled with heavy Russ losses; Rubizhne and Popasna are still not fully under Russ control, and the Ukrainians are continuing their very effecient highly mobile hit-and-run tactics against lumbering Russ along the main roads
- Ukrainians have completely destroyed the electronic warfare facilities on Snake Island (about 140km from the Ukrainian coast, and 140km from Romania) - extremely useful, given the Russ were eavesdropping on NATO communications (from Romania) from there;
- Ukrainians have pushed the Russ further from Kharkiv, now only Grad artillery is in range for the Russ;
- Zusko in the South is getting some reinforcements (mostly Naval infantry) that are well battered from Mariupol, his so-called offensive is keeping Ukranians busy from not swinging back towards Kherson, but it's not doing much else;
- Ukrainians are receiving more and more heavy weapons (proves out the Poles gave them not 100 but 200+ T-72M tanks, well done, Poland!), and quite a few units are now rotated away from the front lines to be able to receive, and start operating the new weapons;
- a last note on the blowing to smithereens of the Russ post on Snake Island - given the very long range of the attack, it is very possible the Ukranians used their new US-supplied M142 HIMARS rocket artillery system proving stuff's getting delivered proper, and immediately put to good use!
