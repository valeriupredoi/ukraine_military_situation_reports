Brief operational update 09 April 2022
======================================

The Russ is overhauling its military leadership and chain of command: so far it has been like this (and I reccommend Tom Cooper's note on this matter https://medium.com/@x_TomCooper_x/supplement-reorganisation-of-the-rfa-command-in-ukraine-d1bb674718fc ): Putin was issuing orders to each of the higher ranking army commanders - these orders were somewhat vague so that he cn't be held accountable for failures, but rather, the generals in the field would be, under the pretext they got the order wrong or they didn't implement it correctly. This explains the chaotic nature of the military operations since February 24 - independent, disjoint, and uncoordinated attacks, directly opposite of the Combined Arms concept of inter-operability between different arms (tanks, infantry, artillery, aviation etc). Things look to be changing though - Army General Alexandr Dvornikov is now appointed commander-in-chief of all the Russ forces fighting in Ukraine - a very high ranking (Army general > Lt General or Col General, ranks of all the other Combined Arms Armies commanders) staff/Headquarters officer that will probably centralize the chain of command and restore it to the old Soviet-era system of Putin order -> HQ -> distributed field commanders. This is not good news for the Ukrainians, but it remains to see what Dvornikov can do with the already chaotic system, troops that refuse to be re-sent to the front, and commanders that are already used to operate on their own - the latter being actually a positive for capable commanders like Mikhail Zusko (in the South). Of course, there is the issue that the Russ still doesn't have capbable NCO's (non-commissioned officers = sargeants) that are capable to carry over and convert officers' orders in the field, but this is another matter, much more fine-grained compared to the bigger picture of the chain of command.

The Russ has cowardly bombed a train station in the town of Kramatorsk (used to evacuate civilians, as well as bring in Ukrainian troops) - this is part of a more systematic attack on the infrastructure in the East, with a number of other railway heads and train stations being bombed. The Russ has blamed it on to the Ukrainians, but they failed to realize that their lie (that the Tochka-U missile system, used in the attack, is only used by Ukrainians) was caught immediately since the 8th Combined Arms Army is well-known to deploy and have used this missile in the past weeks.

On the front lines things are as follows: the Russ has moved from around Kharkiv (even though they bombed the city heavily last night) but made sure to mine their way out; Ukrainians are already fighting heavily in the East (despite mainstream media saying that a large-scale Russ offensive will happen next week - this is already trickling in) - the now (in)famous triangle Izyum-Rubizhne-Popasna centered at its prize town Slovyansk is seeing heavy tank battles - the Russ has not made any land gains there because its operational tempo is somewhat slower in the past few days - in line with the restructuring of the chain of command with Dvornikov's arrival, and the need for the Russ to consolidate units. ISW https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-april-8 is saying the quality of the Russ troops consolidating in the East (a hodge-podge of troops formerly deployed and used around Kyiv, Sumy axis, and Donetsk and Luhansk Republicans, as well as Russ troops fighting there since the start of the war) is questionable - indeed, there are lots of reports that soldiers transferred from the Kyiv region refuse to re-start fighting, and commanders cancelling expired contracts keeping the contracted soldiers in etc. This is probably not that much of a problem compared to the generally positive logistical situation of the Russ in the East - very short supply lines, so I am very afraid of what the outcome would be if the Ukrainians don't get supplied with heavy weapons (see below for a note on that). Mariupol: the Ukrainian garrison, even if cut in half now by a Russ/DNR corridor, is holding, and has just refused a fourth or fifth call to surrender; they are well garrisoned inside the Azovstal steel factory, and supplied by helicopters flying at high speed at grasstop level - these helo ops are extraordinary stuff, the likes of which have probably only been seen during the Vietnam war, with the Battle of Mariupol being a true reproduction of the Battle of Stalingrad, 80 years ago. In Kherson the Ukrainians are pushing from the West, repelling Russ counterattacks and advancing slowly, but hopefully surely.

A note on heavy weapons deliveries to the Ukrainians - heavy gear has been flowing in Ukraine for a while now, but here are the first indications of what they are actually receiving: Slovakia has donated their only S-300 anti-air missile system (a very powerful, long range missile system), after they have received US Patriots, Czechia has shipped a number of T-72M1 tanks (older type, not like the more modern B3 version, but still a more than decent tank), BMP-1 armoured vehicles, Australia is sending Bushmaster MRAPs, the US has been shipping a ton of small weapons and Humvee's, there is rumor (and hopefully more than a rumor) that Cyprus will be sending Mil Mi-35 attack helicopters. Ukraine needs heavy weapons like there's no tomorrow - and they can actually stand a chance to beat the Russ in the next one-two weeks if they act in force, and have the weapons to do that!
