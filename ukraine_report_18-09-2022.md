Ukrainian counteroffensive following on, at a slower pace (due to logistical problems maintaining already stretched lines of supply and communication) but a fast enough paace to deny the Russians and response, whether it be consolidating defence lines or any form of counter-attack. In fact, the Russ is operating in a parallel universe, akin the German Wehrmacht towards the last days of WW2: they continue attacking in the Bakhmut area, where there is zero chance of a breakthrough, given the Ukrainian defence lines, and the very limited effort the Russ is able to put in the attacks - direct cause of severe troop depletion; instead, they should redeploy towards Lyman and the Oskil River where the Ukranians have by now encircled Lyman on three sides, and will probably retake it in the next couple of days. The Ukrainian army is facing supply issues of their own, but are much more efficient at using whatever they have, rotating troops to allow rest&recuperation, and keeping the momentum and holding the initiative at the same time.

The Russian forces have completely lost the intiative on all fronts (meaning, they are only responding to Ukrainian moves, weakly too, and given the highly centralized command system, starting with Putin himself (who is currently feverishly looking for scapegoats), these responses are both late, and inefficient due to commanders deciding to act safely, not to have any fault attributed to them).

I have no doubts that the Ukrainian counter-offesnive both in the South-East Kharkiv, and emerging bits in the Kherson Oblast, aided by partisan action, will continue to push the Russ ever more Eastwards. The Russ has brought in reinforcements (actually even worse - replacements), notably the 3rd Army Corps, that achieved close to nothing; the 20th Combined Arms Army in SE Kharkiv is reduced to a skeleton, and the infamous 1st Guards Tank Army is depleted. Major reorganization and resupply on the Russ side is improbable anytime soon, it now depends how much hardware (specifically artillery) do the Ukrainians have to push the Russ past the pre-war Line of Contact (LOC).
