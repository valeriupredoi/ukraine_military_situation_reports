update on 23 May 2022:

- Kharkiv Oblast: the Russ counter-attack in N-E Kharkiv that previously retook Ternova and Rubizhne (the Northen Rubizhne) has been stopped by the Ukrainians;

The Cauldron:

- Severodonetsk-Lysychansk-Popasna-Izyum cauldron: heavy battles all around it, but it appears that the Russ spearheads from Popasna due North and West, and the one due South from Izyum/Lyman have stalled; the Ukrainians have brought in a lot of reinforcements in the cauldron, and the Russ is extending ever so more their supply/communication lines; the attacker-to-defender ratio is about 1:1 even if the Russ has injected more than 15 new batallion tactical groups; as both Tom Cooper and ISW remark - the Russ, however much trying to change tactics (by bypassing settlements instead of spending time and effort to take them) has conducted this series of operations in fragmented, piecemeal fashion - the (failed) attempts at establishing bridgeheads over the Siverski Donets river near Bilohorivka, then operations from Rubizhne (near Severodonetsk), then now spearheading from Popasna - but never these operations conducted at the same time;
- there are, however, reinforcements that the Russ will be receiving - a couple very long tank columns (11km) heading from the South-East towards Severodonetsk; there already is a huge amassing of both troops and equipment from both the Ukrainians and the Russ in this cauldron, with very heavy Russ frontline aviation support - most of the towns and settlements (Severodonetsk, Popasna, Rubizhne, Voivodivka) being almsot completely destroyed by artillery fire;

There are heavy losses on both sides: Zelensky said that Ukraine is losing about 100 soldiers daily in the battles in Luhansk and Donetsk, whereas the UK MoD has put a realistic estimate of the Russ dead at over 15,000 since the start of the war; Ukraine lost around 2,500 alone in Mariupol (with 20,000 civilians feared dead), but given that they continue mobilization (they have just extended martial lawy until 23 August), and continue to recieve strong weapons support, there will be an inflexion point where they will seize the initiative on all fronts - most estimates put that around July.
