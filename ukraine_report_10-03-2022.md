Frontlines situation 10 March 2022
==================================

**Russ Operational axes:**

- (main) Kyiv: Russ concentration on NW axis of attack; encirclement still not at all possible, but heavy fighting in the streets in the outskirts of Kyiv; E-NE attack from combined Guards Tank Armies (1st and 2nd) that are making their way to Kyiv; 4th Guards Tank Division still lost somewehere en route; Ukrainian military continuing to harass flanks and communication lines of 41st CAA on the East of Dnipr
- (directly supporting) Kharkiv: moderate activity; Sumy: push to encircle but checked by Ukrainian defenders, even mauling attacks of Russ columns trying to enter the city
- Kharkiv still well in Ukrainian control, mauling Ukrainian conter-attacks aroung Chuhiv
- (supporting) Luhansk: no Russ advance
- (supporting) Mariupol and the right (East) spearhead from Crimea (target: linkup with Donetsk/Luhansk):
  stable: Mariupol encircled and still heavily shelled, absolutely catastrophic situation the port city is on (no food, no water, maternity hospital bombed yesterday); renewed push spearhead to Zaporizhiya, but currrently not in force
- (supporting) Mykolayiv and the left spearhead (West) from Crimea (target: Odessa, westward advance):
  Russ shelling heavily the city and still attempting at bypassing it, renewed effort from Kherson area, but not decisive
- Overall: heavy street fighting reported on the NW and E-NE outskirts of Kyiv; but Russ is not able to gain any significant advantage, even after days of regrouping and resupply


**General situation:**

Heavy street fighting has begun on the outskirts of Kyiv, with elements of the Russ Chechen and 1st and 2nd Guards Tank Armiesarriving from NW and E-NE to reinforce the already existing troops; five Batallion Tactictal Groups (BTGs) have attacked Bucha, but were repulsed - this, according to ISW, is noteworthy because the Russ has presumably regrouped and resupplied over the past days, so they should have attacked in force with a lot more than 5 BTGs (note: a Battalion Tactical Group is a combined arms unit comprising of 2-4 infantry companies, an armoured element, artillery and ground attack aviation, all in all about 600-800 officers and enlisted men). The Russ is suffering of troop depletions at every unit level, and reports of desertions are multiplying; conscripts have now been drawn in (after a bizarre episode in which Putin had found out about conscripts being sent to the frontline only from reading a tactical report on the matter yesterday, himself having had declared on state Russ TV that no conscripts would be sent to Ukraine - bollocks).

The Ukrainians are holding firm Sumy, and are denying the Russ any probing attacks in the city - they have mauled a couple attempts of the Russ to cross into town or bypass it from the outskirts; in the same vein, the Ukrainians are making mince of the Russ 6th Combined Arms Army (CAA) around Chuhiv, with the Ukrainians being on the offensive in that area, despita the Russ throwing in yet anotherparatroops brigade, that ended like the others the Russ sent most other places in Ukraine - decimated. Also in the good news, the Russ Rosgvardia (the National Guard) seems to be much better at Mayday parades than at battlefield operations, joining the 4th elite Guards Tank Division in being mauled by the Ukrainian defenders.

In the South the Russ is regrouping to renew a possible attack to Zaporizhyia, but so far they have not been able to muster enough elements to attack in force, same as for the push to Mykolayiv, with the Russ now trying to bypass it. An all-out attack on Odessa from the land is even more distant now.
