Key point: Lyman - the Ukrainian army (ZSU) is pushing to fully encircle Lyman (already encircles from three directions with the supply road being constantly attacked by the Ukrainians). This is the key point right now, and the Russ losing the town will mean the ZSU can link up with their southern spearhead and advance towards Rubizhne and Severodonetsk. The two main problems for the Ukrainians right now are the rush of Russian reinforcements - this is simply a numerical/logistical problem, these reinforcements are Russian citizens that have been brought in from their civilian lives, and have zero military impact, it just takes longer for the Ukrainians to either capture them (prisoner handling/processing is a lengthy operation), or kill them, given the numbers. The Russians are suffering terrible losses among these freshly mobilized troops, immediately sent to the front, but cynically, and despite reports of human waves reduced to nil, they are doing their bit by slowing down the ZSU. The second problem is again stemming from Russian desperation - Putin's order of "not a step back" (akin Stalin's Order 227 from 1942) is causing delays on the Ukrainian side; this is a terrible tactical choice that can result in massive strategic losses - for instance, if Lyman is encircled, and the pocket eliminated, which seems to be the case in a few days, the Russ will lose a lot more troops than if they chose to evacuate. The situation is the same in Kherson, with the Russ troops with their backs to the Dnipro River, and all the bridges blown up, but at least the Ukrainians are more static there themselves, for now.
