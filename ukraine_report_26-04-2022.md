Short update for 25-26 April 2022
=================================

As I mentioned yesterday, the Russ military operations in the East of Ukraine, even though decalred as probing attacks by Ukraine (this is a coy way of labelling the operations, in case there is indeed a breach of their defenses, so to downplay any serious situation - standard reporting during a war, nothing new) - are, in fact, at full capacity, but still very weak and uncoordinated; this is confounded by Ukrainian forces counter-attacking at precise stress points and pushing the Russ before they even attempt tactical encirclements, let alone any strategic ones. Yesterday the Ukrainians counterattacked south of Izyum, and cut whatever the push the Russ tried towards Barvinkove. In the South, Ukrainians in Kherson Oblast cut what looked like a Russ advance of Zusko's 58 CAA towards Mykolayiv and Krivyi Rih, now the Russ is back to consolidating the lines.

False flag attacks took place in Transnistria, the self-proclaimed republic on the Dnister river, East of Moldova. A series of explosions took place in the separatist state on Monday and Tuesday; the Transnistrian leader, Vadim Krasnoselski, declared that these are nothing but destabilizing events, performed by agitators, and his and the Transnistrian attitude is of neutrality towards what he clearly labelled as the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and also sent a message of support to Zelenskyy. Moldova is on pins and needles, but both from strategic and tactical points, the Russ can do absolutely nothing towards a possible invasion of the country. Again, false flag events to sow chaos, and pretend to seem as attacks against Russian-speaking population, old tricks.

In other news, the US is now fully determined to weaken the Russ military to a degree where they won't be able to invade a shopping mall, let alone a neighbouring country - this is what Blinken and Lloyd Austen, the US Defense Secretary, have said yesterday. What does this mean? Lend Lease at the pace of WW2's Lend Lease program - injection of all manners of weapons in Ukraine, backed by increased production of weapons in the US. As Admiral Yamamoto once said - they have awaken a giant - this attitude completely throws out the window the initial caution the US and other NATO members showed at the start of the war; it is strategically feasable, and financially profitable to arm Ukraine to the teeth - win-win, plus a third win for the Ukrainians. This begs the question: will the Ukrainians be able to organize a large-scale counter-offensive when a lot of these weapons have been fully deployed and a lot of their servicemen have been trained to use them? I think yes, but the tactics must change for them, they are waging a terrific active defensive war, to be able to conduct large scale offensive they will have to switch the way they operate.

Also in other news, Germany has decided to send 50 odd Gepard anti-arcraft systems, these are not tanks as you hear on the news, they are called SPAAG (self propelled anti aircraft gun) systems, armed with two 35mm Oerlikon rapid fire guns, and an all-weather radar to detect low and mid-altitude flying aircraft. Frankly, I've no idea why the Germans are offering these old systems to the Ukrainians, SPAAG's have never been popular with any army, and are way more useful in attack roles against infantry (guns at horizontal position). But hey, every little helps!
