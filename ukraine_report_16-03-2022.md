Frontlines situation 16 March 2022
==================================

**Russ Operational axes:**

- (main) Kyiv: Russ concentration on NW axis of attack; no visible progress in the last 24h, company-size attacks checked by Ukrainians
- (directly supporting) Kharkiv: moderate activity; Sumy: Ukrainian active defending, Russ still trying to push to encircle Sumy, no chance
- Kharkiv still well in Ukrainian control, in SE - Izyum advance stopped by Ukrainians
- (supporting) Luhansk: on LOC Russ slowly pushing, no notable advance
- (supporting) Mariupol and the right (East) spearhead from Crimea (target: linkup with Donetsk/Luhansk):
  stable: Mariupol encircled and still heavily shelled, Russ (large) attack pushed back by Ukrainians
- (supporting) Mykolayiv and the left spearhead (West) from Crimea (target: Odessa, westward advance):
  Russ needs to clear Mariupol first so they can free up troops, otherwise push to Mykolaiv checked, and Kherson airport shelled by Ukrainians, Russ helicopters destroyed, it appears the Ukrainians are pushing back towards Kherson


**General situation:**

Quiet most all fronts. When the Russ is quiet, shit's afoot.
