Frontlines situation 16 March 2022
==================================

**Russ Operational axes:**

- (main) Kyiv: Russ concentration on NW axis of attack; no visible progress in the last 24h, company-size attacks checked by Ukrainians
- (directly supporting) Kharkiv: moderate activity; Sumy: Ukrainian active defending, Russ still trying to push to encircle Sumy, no chance
- Kharkiv still well in Ukrainian control, in SE - Izyum advance stopped by Ukrainians
- (supporting) Luhansk: on LOC Russ slowly pushing, no notable advance
- (supporting) Mariupol and the right (East) spearhead from Crimea (target: linkup with Donetsk/Luhansk):
  stable: Mariupol encircled and still heavily shelled, Russ (large) attack pushed back by Ukrainians
- (supporting) Mykolayiv and the left spearhead (West) from Crimea (target: Odessa, westward advance):
  Russ needs to clear Mariupol first so they can free up troops, otherwise push to Mykolaiv checked, and Kherson airport shelled by Ukrainians, Russ helicopters destroyed, it appears the Ukrainians are pushing back towards Kherson


**General situation:**

Quiet most all fronts. When the Russ is quiet, shit's afoot.

Tactical situation on March 16th 2022: tagline would be "When the Russ is quiet, shit's afoot." - very minor operations (see below for a few more details on each axis/front line), but it seems the Russ is regrouping/resupplying/calling up reserves and all manners of dubious paramilitary groups. More worryingly, apparently there are promising signs from the peace negotiations - and knowing Kremlin, that is not a good sign - probably buying time do something. Not sure what; although the Ukrainians still have plenty of troops reserves to fully deploy (they are mobilized but not deployed yet). Another worrying fact are statements by Putin and a couple more very senior Kremlin penpushniks saying stuff a la "a dismembered Russia has no place in this world" and "these upcoming days are the most important days in the history of Russia". NATO is all but confident the Russ Army has been rendered useless, so I'm a bit uneasy that these next 8-12 days are indeed actually going to be the "peak of the pandemic".
