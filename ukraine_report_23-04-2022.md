Brief update for 22-23 April 2022
=================================

A pro-Kremlin news agency (they are all pro-Kremlin by now, in Russisa) has published, and immediately deleted, a report giving an exact number of dead (KIA) and missing (MIA) Russ service men in the war so far: 13,414 confirmed dead, and close to 20,000 KIA+MIA; it also details that 116 crew from Moskva are confirmed dead, with another 100 missing, confirming later reports saying about half the crew was lost, with the other half wounded. This is a screenshot off Tom Cooper's post on Medium, which is, in turn a cached screenshot of the post from Readovka. These numbers are in good accordance with the numbers published by the Ukrainian General Staff. This means, literally the Russ has lost in two months the number of servicemen they lost in the entirety of the Afghan war, that lasted nie years.

The Russ is happy to report that the air war over Ukraine is being won by the VKS (the Russ Aero-space Force), which in reality, is starting to be quite the opposite: by now the Ukrainians have such a large number of MANPADS (man-portable anti-aircraft systems) that the Russ birds are falling from the sky like stones: the Ukrainians shot down an Mi-8 helo yesterday, then they shot down the Mi-8 sent to rescue the downed crew, and, for good measure, they shot down the Ka-52 attack helo that was supposed to provide top cover; those added to another four or five other fixed-wing aircraft (including UAVs), and a few missiles. Indeed, the Russ is now conducting order 200 sorties daily, but most of these are done at night - if the Ukrainian air defenses have been neutralized, as Moscow brags, why fly mostly only at night?

Very interesting development: five separate large fires destroyed key military and military research buildings (with substantial loss of life too) inside Russia. I, as well as other commentators, have no clue what's going on there, but this is anything but helping the Russ war effort.

On the command and control side of things, Putin is purging the Russ command like in the days of Stalin: the commaned of the Black Sea Fleet (Osipov) has been removed, 6th CAA and 1st Guards Tank Division commanders as well, and a significant number of senior military commanders are being "investigated". This is not helping the Russ war effort either, since the replacemnt commanders (of which they have aplenty) are likely to lack battlefield experience, and, even in the case where they'd actually be competent, they'd be pressed for immediate results, and will likely be reporting only the "good news".

On the front in the East: the Ukrainians have offered stiff resistance to the Russ slow grinding advance, precise artillery fire from the Ukrainians destroyed two convoys East of Izyum, and they also pushed back into Popasna and Rubizhne, both towns now being contested by the Ukrainians; elsewhere in the SE, the Russ have captured a number of villages, but the overall progress is minimal, with the Russ already five days in the offensive. Unlike what Putin said two days ago, the Azovstal steel works, where the last defenders of Mariupol are holed up, has been bombed again yesterday, and attempts at storming it have restarted. "Seal it so not even a fly can get out" means bombing it with bunker-buster bombs, and storming it, apparently.
