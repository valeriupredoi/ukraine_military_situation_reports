Brief operational update 03 April 2022
======================================

Russ troops continue to withdraw from NW, North, NE, and East of Kyiv. Ukrainians fully retook most of the Kyiv Oblast. These are Russ withdrawls/retreats, in a hurry, but not routed by Ukrainians; these Russ troops are in very bad condition, and even if regrouped/consolidated at bases in Russia via Belarus, they will be needing alot more time, complement and supplies to be fully functional again - probably to be deployed in the East now. They left a trail of destruction behind: Ukrainian engineers are now busy cleaning up the very many mines and booby-traps they planted before leaving; moreover, they murdered civilians, and looted everything they found. They left a large number of their vehicles, and their own dead, without burying them, simply left lying in ditches and in fields; of interest are the many VDV (Paratroopers) dead and left about, and large quantities of ammunition and litter - goes to show in what poor state of morale they were, and how fast the whole momentum collapsed for them. Fuck them, if you asked me!

In the East of Kyiv and along the H-01 highway to Chernihiv things are evolving quickly too - that is, the Russ is hauling ass, and this time around the Ukrainians managed to rout the 1st Tank Division with a pincer movement at Sloboda; the Russ is still maintaining a narrow corridor outside Chernihiv to keep the flow of retreating Russ convoys to Russia, but Chernihiv has had their first quiet night yesterday, in more than five weeks.

Kharkiv is still being shelled though, but the Ukrainian 93rd Mech is targeting Russ positions there; a bit worse off is Izyum, to the South, where the Russ has penetrated and occupied the city yesterday - they used TOS-1M's thermobaric rockets, heavily too - it looks like now they need to resprt to more and more brutal weapons, since their troop quality plummeted; they paused operations in Izyum today.

Donbass/Luhansk seem to be the main operational theatres now - the Ukrainians have reported that they barred at least seven (large) Russ counterattacks in the area in the past three days - this is attrtional warfare, something that the Ukrainians can't afford to wage since they have much more limited supplies tha the Russ - and their lines of communications are stretched, compared to the Russ' very short lines in the East.

Having said that, the West is now pumping in increasingly heavier military equipment - from tanks, armoured personnel carriers, to missile batteries, and artillery; they have finally - FINALLY - and lots of analysist, including myself, could have told them this two weeks ago - thet the Ukrainians can now actually win this war, or, at least, inflict enough damage (already done!) to the Russ that they are in a very good position to negotiate.

South - Mariupol: it's a mess - Mizintsev, The Butcher of Mariupol, is throwing verything at the Azov and Naval Regiment the Ukrainians are still defending with, including thermobaruc rockets, and Kadyrov's Chechens - which, by the way, are crap - even though Kadyrov himself is there now, calling for the Ukrainians to capitulate, to which he got a sharp Go Fuck Yourself from the Ukrainian garrison (which is now on a single meal a day, and drinking industrial water).

South: Kherson - no observable moves from the Ukrainians in the past 24h; Odess - the Russ have shelled some super-strategic-important-decisive objective (in the first wave of missiles they hit a residential neighbourhood, the send wave hit some oil dump); the way they did it though - with anti-ship missiles that are not really supposed to be launched against land targets shows they are on red on ballistic missiles.
