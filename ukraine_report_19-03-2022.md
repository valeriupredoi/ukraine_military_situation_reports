Frontlines situation 19 March 2022
==================================

**Russ Operational axes:**

- (main) Kyiv: Russ concentration on NW axis of attack; no visible progress in the last 24h
- (directly supporting) Kharkiv: moderate activity; Sumy: Ukrainian active defending
- Kharkiv still well in Ukrainian control, in SE - Izyum advance stopped by Ukrainians, Izyum itself actually in Ukrainian hands; active defending (counter-attacks) all around Chernihiv, harassing attacks on Russin rears and supply lines
- (supporting) Luhansk: on LOC Russ slowly pushing, no notable advance
- (supporting) Mariupol and the right (East) spearhead from Crimea (target: linkup with Donetsk/Luhansk):
  dire situation: Mariupol is cut off (has been for days now) but the Ukrainian General Staff has reported
  they can't counter-attack to relieve the city; heavy street fighting
- (supporting) Mykolayiv and the left spearhead (West) from Crimea (target: Odessa, westward advance):
  large-scale Ukrainian counter-offesnive in the Kherson region and south of Mykolaiv, pushed beck all Russ forces and bombed airfirld near Kherson with multiple Russ helicopters destroyed


**General situation:**

In around Kyiv - not much is happening; in the West (Lviv) the Russ has targeted an airfield and underground ammunition dump with cruise missiles (they say it was a hypersonic ballistic "Kinzhal", or "Dagger", missile off a MiG-31K heavy fighter jet - the missile was still in testing last year so slim chances, or, possible - given that until now the Russ has fired more than 1000 cruise and ballistic missiles, a good fraction for its full arsenal of such weapons); again, this is seen as a threat for the weapons transports from the West - but, given these transports follow intricate routes, and are done by truck, a single hypersonic Wunder-Shmunder Weapon is not going to put the fear in the Ukrainian truck drivers.

NE and East (Sumy, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Izyum) is still seeing active and strong Ukrainian defense: they stopped the Russ offensive via Izyum, and it appears that Izyum city itself is still in Ukrainian hands (contrary to reports from 2-3 days ago); this axis is extremely important since the Sumy Axis links up directly with Kyiv in the West via the E40 highway (on which the Russ is not merrily going because they bypassed a number of villages held by Ukrainians along it, and everytime a Russ convoy passes through, it gets attacked and mauled) and with the Eastern and Southern flanks (Donbas, Luhansk and Mariupol further South). A Russ breach around Kharkiv would give the Russ room to move South and encircle the Ukrainian veteran units defending the Line of Contact (LOC) with the Donbas and Luhansk fronts, and also, would allow them to fan out North and cut the land corridor between Sumy/Chernihiv and Kyiv controlled by the Ukrainians, securing their (Russ) ever exposed lines of communication and supply. Rest assured, Kharkiv is well defended (even actively) by the Ukrainians.

South: Mykolaiv and the Kherson region saw a large Ukrainian counter-offensive in the past 2-3 days, pushing the Russ well clear off the Southern tip of Mykolaiv, and destroying a lot of Russ equipment (including a number of helicopters stationed at Kherson airport - during that bombing of the airport the Russ has lost their fifth general, Lt. Gen. Mordvichev, the commander of the 8th Combined Arms Army (CAA) in the South - the more the merrier). Thus, the Russ assault on Mykolaiv is virtually over.

Mariupol is a completely different story though: extremely heavy street fighting going on in the city, pushing through to the city center; the Ukrainian General Staff said they can not find the forces to relieve the city, with the closest Ukrainian units outside the city at 100-150km from it, and airlifting supplies and troops is impossible with the Russ controlling the skies above Mariupol. Yje civilian poulation that is still there (about 300,000) is in a terrible condition. It is possible that Mariupol could hold for a few more days if not weeks - the Russ is throing everything and the kitchen sink at it - Donbas People Republic morons, naval infantry, Kadyrov's Chechens, reserves, Rosgvardia, cadets - you name it, but all these troops are far less experienced than the Ukrainian defenders; it all depends on how many supplies (water is at a premium) and ammo reserves the Ukrainians have.
