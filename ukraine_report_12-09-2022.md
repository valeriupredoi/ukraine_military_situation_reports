Major Ukrainian victory in Karkiv Oblast
========================================

Ukrainian forces have inflicted a major operational defeat on Russia, recapturing almost all Kharkiv Oblast in a rapid counter-offensive.

- the Ukrainians have employed very successfully Western weapons (like the HIMARS system) to sever Russian communications and supply lines;
- the Ukrainians have re-captured in the last five days more territory than the Russians have occupied during their whole campaign since April;
- they have used the offensive in the South as a feint, or diversion - discussing it openly, and leading the Russ to believe that was the main operational axis - this is classic diversionary tactics, that some of my friends have immediately understood; NOTE however, that the offensive in the Suth (Kherson) may be converted to a full-scale offensive, now that the objectives in Kharkiv Oblast have been accomplished;
- Izyum was recaptured, ending the Russian prospect of extending the campaign in the Donetsk; moreover, capturing Izyum seriously jeopardizes the Russian occupation in Donetsk;
- the Ukrainians have captured Kupiansk, a vital node of communications and resupply to the Donetsk front, Izyum falling after was an immediate effect of the Russian lines of supp;y and communication being severed with the capture of Kupiansk
- THIS IS A DECISIVE POINT of the war, but it doesn't end it; see it more like the Battle of Stalingrad, or the Battle of Kursk - it severly weakens the Russian strategic positioning (strategically it denies the Russ advances on pretty much any axis) and the capacity to wage war (the Russ loast a lot of manpower and materiel during the retreat, which was anything but orderly or a fighting retreat, with losses of 8,000-10,000 regualars of Russ army), but it doesn't end it;
- indeed, the Ukrainian advance was so rapid (almost on par with the Blitzkrieg in France, 1940 or Schwartzkopf advance into Iraq in 1991) that the Ukrainians themselves risk over extending their comms and supply lines - in the long run, when peace will come, this will be re-taken Ukrainian land, but for now it is a battlefield situation, so the Ukrainian forces will have to stop and consolidate; it appears that's not just yet though...
