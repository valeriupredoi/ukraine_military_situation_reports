Brief update for 15-16 April 2022
=================================

I am going to start with the awesome fact that there is an actual Wikipedia article dedicated to the reply the Moskva (Russ cruise missile cruiser, flagship of the Russian Black Sea Fleet, sunk a couple days ago) got from the Ukrainian defenders on Snake Island (in the Black Sea, close to Romania, and formerly belonged to Romania) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_warship,_go_fuck_yourself

as well as a commemorative stamp Ukraine issued in one million copies three days ago, just before the ship was sunk.

Moskva (former Slava, before recommissioning in 2000, built 49 years ago) was the flagship of the Russ Black Sea Fleet, and by far the most powerful vessel currently in the Black Sea; its replacement would cost around $750 million, but even so, in accordance with the Montreux Treaty from 1936, Turkey has the right to close the Bosphorus and Dradanelles straits to any other foreign military vessels, and they did back in February, allowing only the exit, and not the entry of Russ naval ships. Moskva was the command ship of the Black Sea Fleet too, operational command meaning coordinating naval ops and air defense and the launching of cruise missiles against Ukraine; so this needs to be replaced to another ship now, probably not a major problem for the Russ, but a headache nonteheless. It appears that a lot of her crew has perished - reports say only about 60 men made it with their lives, out of a complement of 510, with the captain dead too. Another blow for the Russ is that they've not lost a flagship since the Russo-Japanse war of 1904, and we all know what that war heralded, even before the terrible losses of the Russian Army in WW1 - the complete change of regime. At any rate, given that the Russ has been extremely careless with ammunition trasnport and storage in this war (see the blown up ship in Berdyansk earlier), it is perfectly plausible that that was gross negligence; what hints to the fact that the Ukrainians actually sank her (with a couple of Neptune missiles) is that the Russ has now pulled all their ships in the Black Sea at a distance outside anti-ship missile range; another possibility was that the ship (in rough seas, and at night) has hit a wandering mine - of which the Russ have let loose a lot of them - the Turkish and Romanian navies are currently busy cleaning them up since they have floated away into commercial shipping lanes. An unnamed US military highup has told Reuters that indeed it was the Ukrainians who sank her - ok, we don't know just yet - whatever the cause, it is a huge morale boost for the Ukrainians, and equally, a huge blow to the Russ morale. Another positive is that the Russ is now seriously crippled towards going ahead with an amphibious landing at Odessa - not just because the Moskva was crucial in terms of fire power, but also since the Ukrainian anti-ship defenses are on point, assuming she was sank, rather than suffered an accident (mine or ammunition ignition). My theory is that it was a bit of both - during wartime a lot of the peacetime safety regulations may get forgotten - they shouldn't be - but, as an example, during the naval Battle of Jutland in WW1, most of the British ships were sunk due to the fact that the sailors onboard ignored ammunition safety rules and kept the magazine room's doors open to deliver gun powder faster to the guns, and when a German shell hit the ship, instead of normal localized damage, it would result in the detonation of the powder magazine, since fire would reach it immediately; so here, I reckon something similar happened, due to one or two Ukrainian hits, that, had the Russ stuck to the ship's safety rules, would have created damage, but not resulted in the ship's magazine exploding. Note - it is reported that most of the crew perished when it exploded, and the damage due to the explosion was catastrophic, the Russ basically towing the hulk, with all superstructures and decks gone by then.
