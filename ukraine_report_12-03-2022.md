Frontlines situation 10 March 2022
==================================

**Russ Operational axes:**

- (main) Kyiv: Russ concentration on NW axis of attack; no visible progress in the last 24h, some units pulled back to Sumy to reinforce against Ukrainian counter-attacks
- (directly supporting) Kharkiv: moderate activity; Sumy: Ukrainian active defending
- Kharkiv still well in Ukrainian control, Russ deploying reservists
- (supporting) Luhansk: no Russ advance
- (supporting) Mariupol and the right (East) spearhead from Crimea (target: linkup with Donetsk/Luhansk):
  stable: Mariupol encircled and still heavily shelled, several Russ attacks pushed back by Ukrainians
- (supporting) Mykolayiv and the left spearhead (West) from Crimea (target: Odessa, westward advance):
  it appears Zusko was relieved of his command, spearhead turned North (no sane tactical reason), even so, minimal Russ effort due to troop depletion
- Overall: no progress at all from the Russ on any front, probably resupplying and regrouping, very active Ukrainin defending operations


**General situation:**

Unlike what the media is saying (all doom and gloom, Red storm approaching Kyiv), the Russ has achieved close to nothing in the past 24h; the overall impression is of a very tired boxer that needs frequent breaks to cath his breath - the Russ needed the past 24h to resupply and regroup (whatever's left to regroup) after failed attacks on 10-11 March; reports say that the Ukrainians conducted vigorous small-scale counter-attacks in around the NW districts of Kyiv, and have retaken a number of settlements around there (possibly Bucha?), and the Russ is still trying to cross the Irpin river, with no joy. Elsewhere in around Chernihiv and Sumy axis, the Ukrainians are harassing the 6 CAA depleted battalions so badly, that the Russ is now pulling away elements of the 2nd Guards Tank Army from NW Kyiv back into the East; in the South it appears that Zusko, arguably the most talented Russ general among the bunch of incompetents, has now been relieved of his command; the few BTGs (battalion tactical groups) that were meant to turn West towards closer to Odess have now turned North instead, with no possible sane tactical explanation as to why. Reports come in about the state of the Russ troops in the South - the bitterly cold weather appears to have frozen all will to fight, and the lack of food is not making things any better for them.

Overall situation recap: the Russ has fully deployed all their trrops plus a heap of reinforcements (220k + paramilitary (Wagner) at 10k plus Chechens, and Rosgvardia) but they took massive losses (conservative numbers at 12-15k dead and wounded), so the Russ now has a lot of incomplete or right out fully depleted units; efforts are to bring in Syrian and African fighters (which BTW have little combat experience) but those units will face a completely alien terrain and climate - if the Russ complains about -10C, imagine what those poor sods from Africa will say. Kyiv simply can't be taken with such a dire deployment situation. This is why Putin is now trying to coerce Belarus to join the fight (several false flag incidents took place yesterday, with Russ aviation attacking a couple villages in Belarus) but each time the agressor has been promptly identified as Russian, and not Ukrainian (stories of a ballistic missile that was idnetified as Russin while the missile was still in flight - not confirmed). Meanwhile, the Russ artillery and aviation is still pounding on the civillians, in the hope they will lose the will to endure, and the Ukrainian governemnt will lose the support from them. Good luck with that!
