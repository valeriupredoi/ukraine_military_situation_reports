Quick update on the situation in Ukraine, as of today 31 May 2022: Russ are attacking Severodonetsk with everything and their dog, focusing almost solely on this effort - this is clearly the result of higher ups political determination (or, narrowmind) - the city is destroyed and offers no tactical or strategical value, just political fanfare, pretty much like Stalingrad in WW2 (just because it bore Stalin's name). As such (and am very happy and relieved to hear), the Ukrainians are reported to have started withdrawing - in an orderly fashion, to Lysychansk. The same is happening - orderly withdrawl, with excellent rearguard operations, from Lyman towards Slovyansk - the Russ will attempt to march towards Slovyansk, but reports come that the Ukrainians are blowing the Russ to heavens high on the Izyum-Slovyansk-Bakhmut line, with American M777 howitzers, and other long range artillery pieces, and are also still keeping hold of the T1302 and T1303 supply lines to Lysychansk. The Ukrainians are also cutting the Russ to pieces around Popasna - the Russ field commanders are unwilling to continue pushing there but the higher ups from Moscow are making them do that, against all tactical odds. This shows both the incapacity of the Russ Army to maintain momentum in different points at the same time (needing to rotate the points of maximum pressure - currently at Severodonetsk, will prob shift to Slovyansk), and the heavy influence in decision making from the very top - these points are not news, but rather, shows they really don't learn from their past mistakes. Below photo is of a light armoured column of the 76 VDV (paratroops) smashed to bits by precise Ukrainian artillery fire, in the Popasna area. Further down the South things are quieter - the Russ have not made any ground around Avdiivka, and the Ukrainian counter-attack in Kherson Oblast (started around May 28, more like a diversion, rather than something that might develop into a full blown counter-offensive) has temporarily halted - Russ 49 CAA really has its communication lines well too extended, so the Ukr counter-attack is nicely placed both in time and location.
