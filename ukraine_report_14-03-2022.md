Not much to say for today
=========================

Russ forces have done close to nothing all day of the 13th March except for still shelling Ukrainian cities and conducting some operations in the East, notably taking Izyum - their aim probably to cut off the Eastern defenders - this is far from realistic at the moment since it would mean a large attack on Zaporizhyia, taking the city and pushing N-NE to link up with the forces south of Kharkiv - the Russ simply doesn't have the forces needed for this type of large scale operation, plus they would not be able to do it fast enough for the Ukrainians not to effect a strategic retreat.

Russ has been active in the West, in the air, that is - they attacked the airfield at Yavoriv, 10km from the border with Poland, justifying that foreign mercenaries and Western armaments were based there; the attack, very precise and powerful - was done (most probably) using cruise missiles launched from strategic bombers based at Saratov Air Force Base, and given the Ukrainians say they launched more than 30 missiles, it means a whole squadron of (probably) Tu-22M3's launched the missiles from outside Ukrainian air space - that costed Putin 30-40 million USD!

A little bit about what the Russ is doing troops-wise: no known troop movements from within Russia at the moment, although reports are indicating they are moving troops away from Nagorno-Karabakh, and peace keepers from Azerbaijan, plus the holy crusaders from Syria and Lybia - that'll take ages to arrive and acclimatize, only to be decimated by Ukrainian National Guards, that are already veterans.

A bit about the Kyiv "garrison" (which pretty much amounts to an entire Combined Arms Army): I heard reports of what the Ukrainians have in there - enough troops and equipment to last for months, especially if the Russ can not organize itself into a large scale attack.
