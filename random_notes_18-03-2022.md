Random notes during conflict lull
=================================

Here are a few notes that you will not hear in the media, and that will help a bit understanding what is actually going on right now:

- Russ forces have mostly ceased offensive operations (and even withdrew the 58 CAA (Combined Arms Army) from Mykolaiv towards Kherson) - this in part due to regrouping/resupplying/consolidating positions, and in part due to heavy losses that need to be replenished; unfortunately, this is NOT a defeat, but rather, a logical step the Russ forces are taking to deal with the situation they're in: Ukrainians have fought them into a corner, but that doesn't mean they can not go on the offensive again, after redeploying and adding to their complements; it may well be that even after going back on the offensive, the Ukrainians will stop them in their tracks again (given the comparatively poor quality of their reinforcements) but Ukrainian forces have suffered losses too, and they are doing right now exactly what the Russ is doing too - consolidation, and resupplying; there is also the possibility that the Russ may use brutal, non-conventional force too, but I will not examine this here;
- Russ continues to commit war crimes: this, however terrible it is, should not come as a surprise: it is part and parcel of their military strategy (an example: in Syria, the Russ High Command was provided by the UN with a list of all the hospitals in the country, together with their GPS coordinates - what did the Russ do? They bombed ALL those hospitals!); the idea that if one writes "KIDS" in large letters in front of a building, or they put Red Crosses on buses that will deter the Russ from attacking them is wrong - they will immediately target those, via a well established chain of command that doesn't flinch a single bit when ordered to attack such targets. This is valid for VKS (Russ Air Force) pilots too - they are given coordinates, and no actual descriptions of targets, and they fulfil their bombing mission, but they know full well (especially if they are senior officers) that their last destroyed target may have been a school or a maternity. The brutality is so engrained in the Russ military that it has become routine and norm;
- MiG/Sukhoi fighter planes will benefit the Ukrainians greatly if NATO countries donate them - this is totally wrong. There is a fairly complicated argument about this that boild down to two ideas: the Ukrainians have much better use of Western anti-aircraft systems (lighter ones: MANPADs, Stingers, the awesome Biritish Starstreak missile system, all these for lower level flying Russ aircraft; these are simple enough to learn their operation in short time) and former Soviet ones (the Slovak S-300s) for longer range/higher altitude flying Russ, these are complex and need time to learn their trade, but the Ukrainians already had them in their arsenal, so they know how to operate them) because these systems are mobile, don't need bulky fuel dumps, low maintenance, don't need airfields and infrastructure that the Russ keep pounding on, and are extremely effective; they also need UCAVs (combat drones) - Switchblades and Bayraktars, for the same reasons (ok Bayraktars need airstrips and fuel depots, but at a fraction of the scale of a squadron of MiGs);
- Finally (the odd one out): why do the Russ now put cages on their tanks? This shows the level of fear the Russ has now of the Ukrainian anti-tank missiles and their attacks, thinking that a cage will help with the detonation of shape charges of the Ukrainian RPGs outside the tank (when making contact with the cage, rather than the actual tank turret); desperation measures that lead nowhere since NLAWs or Javelins go through like hot knives through butter.
