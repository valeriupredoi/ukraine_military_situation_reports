Popasna focal point (center of mass): Russ is trying to push to Noth North-West, aiming to capture the T1302 main supply road for the Ukrainians in the Lysychansk/Severodonetsk area - this is a very important supply line;
- Russ has changed tactics and is now bypassing settlements without attempting at taking them, this ensures speed of operations and the "shock effect" - in fairness, the speed has not been extraordinary, but still, the pace and tempo is much higher now then in past operations;
- 76th VDV (paratroop) division is there working with 336th Independent Guards Naval Infantry Brigade, both units benefiting from excellent railway supply lines around Popasna - one of the reasons why the push is so effective (thanks to Tom Cooper for identifying this supply lines benefit for the Russ) - going further will buy the Russ distance (land) but will extend the supply lines that have rail heads stop at Popasna, trucks resupply really doesn't work well for the Russ;
- further North-East of Kharkiv the Russ has retaken Ternova and Rubizhne (the other Rubizhne) and has now barred the Ukrainians from overrunning Vovchansk (an important Russ supply lines node, from Belgorod to the South); it's only normal they did this since there's been massive assemblying of troops in Russia at Belgorod; what the Russ is doing now is they're securing supply lines and digging in tryoing to keep a foothold in Kharkiv Oblast - unclear as to why though - either to ensure their forces retreat without issues, or to keep access points for a future renewed offesnive (low probability for the latter since they've blown all the bridges while retreating);

Putin is far from giving up: he is actually conducting covert mobilization in Russia at this very moment, with more and more draft-aged Russians becoming disenchanted with both the war and the illegal mobilization.
