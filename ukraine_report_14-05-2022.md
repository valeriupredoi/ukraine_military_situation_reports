- Ukraine has won the Battle of Kharkiv! Russ troops are withdrawing, orderly, but withdrawing towards, and past the Russian border, with only two Separate Motor Rifle brigades left within the Ukrainian territory to ensure rearguard defense; the Ukrainians are now poised to attack some of the Russ communication lines from Belgorod (Russia) to the Izyum front, and can release units to reinforce that front, or to attack behind the Russ lines North of Izyum (of which I have been hearing about such a counter-attack for three days now, but no actual official reports); the Russ have been reinforcing border defenses around Belgorod and Bryansk - they're crapping their pants the Ukrainians will not stop at the border! And they aren't, with sabotage and UKR special forces already inside Russia;
- more good news: the Ukrainians have been blowing up Russ pontoon bridges over the Siverski Donets River in a bloody whack-a-mole game like there's no tomorrow: a couple of days ago (May 11) they blew up one with precise artillery fire, destroying what looked like an entire Russ batallion tactical group (60-70 vehicles), yesterday they blew up another one, with very high Russ loss too; building floating pontoon bridges (built from pre-fabricated buoyant subassembles, that get connected together like LEGO, and laid over the water) are dangerous matters for the invading army - they need to be built and laid over the water in the open, and they are excellent targets for either air attacks or accurate artillery fire; the Russ is concentrating a lot of force nearby these bridges, so they can cross as fast as possible, therefore, a pinpointed artillery attack not only destroys the bridge but also a lot of the military gathered around it for crossing;

- (see attached pictures of all the destruction around the destroyed bridges: the photos are a combination of the latest destroyed bridge from yesterday, and the one destroyed on May 11, both with heavy Russ losses)

- a bit of a worrying note at the end: the Russ is now trying to advance along the M-03 highway from Popasna due North towards Bakhmut-Izyum, but so far the Ukrainians have interdicted them.

Note about the evolution of the war: back in early March, when I already had enough information on the Russ terrible tactics, I predicted that the war will be over by the end of April (based purely on Russ inflexible tactics and their heavy losses): proves out I was wrong by about 2 weeks - where we are now is very close to where Ukraine was before the invasion, if we are looking at landgrab by the Russ. Of course there is still heavy fighting in the East, but, if any of the two sides would have the will, the war could end now: Ukraine would lose a very small fraction of her pre-invasion land - hence claiming victory by repulsing the invaders, and the Russ could claim some sort of victory too, having established the bridge between Crimea and the East via Mariupol, and taking Kherson (although am not sure how long they'd be able to hold those cities while facing fierce partisan actions). Of course this is not the case - Ukrainians are more confident than ever they can actually kick the Russ out of all the land they grabbed even before the invasion, and the Russ ie Putin, against all tactical and strategic rules and evidence (that they're losing this show badly) they doggedly keep pushing, and losing.
