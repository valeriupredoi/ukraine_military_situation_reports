Brief operational update 11 April 2022
======================================

The Russ continues to consolidate and redeploy troops to the East via Blogorod, and Kursk as the main staging points for troop reorganization and further deployment. The Ukrainians have said that the Russ has order 60,000 troops already deployed in the East, but it is unclear if those contain DNR/LNR or any other non-Russian military elements - like Chechens, militias etc. What is clear though is that the Russ is bringing units from all over the country - like the 18th Guards Motor Rifle Division pictured by the Maxar satellite. They are also forcibly conscripting any men in Donetsk and Luhansk, regardless if they have any physical disabilities or if they are key workers in protected industry - inspectors walking in towns and conscripting any male citizen; they are also reported to have revoked contract ends for regular contracted Russian soldier, and are either forcing or enticing with monetary rewards the troops that fought in the North and NE, and are now refusing to re-enter combat.

Judging from the wide effort to gather troops, the Russ is most probably aiming at penetrating Ukraine through Donbass, and not stopping in the East but rather, aiming to link up with the troops assaulting mariupol (hoping the siege will be over by then) and aiming at capturing as many key cities as possible, probably even turning North towards Kyiv. This will need very large resources, but they will hope that the bulk of the Ukrainian army, the most combat-effective units that are currently on the Line of Contact in the East, will have been encircled and destroyed by then. Ramzan Kadyrov, the Chechen puppet, probably in a drunken stupor, has declared exactly this earlier today. Absolute nonesense if you asked me, since this will mean the Russ will need three maybe four times more troops than they can muster now. It is very important that the Ukrainian line does not break on the Izyum-Slovyansk axis, and the Russ does not envelop the LOC southward; it is also important that Kharkiv holds (if they decide to sweep through it). A few Ukrainian decisive victories inside the Izyum-Rubizhne-Poltava-Slovyans quadrant and further in the Slovyansk corner would stop the Russ from advancing, and give the Ukrainians a good chance to rout them towards their own border, towards Belogorod. For now, both sides are in expectaction, even if, despite what's been said on the news, fighting is raging, just not at the titanic scale the next week might bring in terms of tank battles.

Mariupol needs to hold for a bit longer - and it pains me badly to write about this martyr city - the horrors that have happened there and are happening right now are beyond imagination: militarily it is in a dire situation for the Ukrainian defenders - the Russ have completely cut in half the garrison and are attacking the two resulting pockets: the Azovstal steel factory in the East, and the neighborhoods West of the fishing port, that the Russ have captured on April 10. The Ukrainian 36th Marines Regiment purportedly posted on Facebook a few hours ago that they are down to their last ammunition, and have not eaten in days, their wounded piling up, with no chance of being evacuated; this is most probably the Russ hacking their Facebook account and posting this (there are clues for this) - plus, ISW has reported that the Russ has not made any gains against the Marines in the past 24h. But this is not far from the truth, and those guys are the heroes of Stalingrad and Bastogne, in the 21st century! Mizintsev has already attacked them with all manners of explosives (including TOS-1s thermobaric rockets), and now there are fears of attacks with phosphorous bombs (incendiary bombs) - meant to create fireballs that propagate through buildings. That would mean hundreds if not thousands of civilians will die - there are already reports that the Russ is building crematoria, and digging dountless mass graves. I'll stop here.

On a more positive side, there is a chance Ukraine will receive 50 odd Leopard 1 (probably 1A5) tanks from Germany - these are very capable tanks (with a beautiful L7 105mm gun), but are old - they can still be powerful enough if accompanied by modern ammunition though; Poland is giving the Ukrainians 100 T-72M1 tanks (them receiving 250 M1A2 Sep V3 Abrams tanks - absolute beasts, arguably the best tank in the world at the moment). So there is enough good will to help out, the only question is - will all this offensive gear (see that the Ukrainians received mostly defensive gear so far) arrive in time for the battles in the East? One hopes.
