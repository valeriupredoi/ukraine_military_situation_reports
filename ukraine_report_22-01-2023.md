A few notes about air war over Ukraine: Russia avoiding a similar disaster to Operation Rolling Thunder
=======================================================================================================

Some analysts compare the current war in Ukraine with the long and equally destructive war between Iran and Irak in the '80s - that may be (hopefully not as long as that war) but the situation in the air during that war was much different from the current conflict: both Iran and Irak had powerful air forces, and Iran managed to keep itself in the war in the first year by using its superior air force. However, Ukraine has a very small air force, and yet, after almost one year of conflict, Russia not only has not managed to obtain air superiority (let alone air supremacy) but it is struggling in the air, with low number of sorties, and fairly minimal impact on the war on the ground (we are not talking about ballistic/cruise missile strikes here, but rather, the frontline/tactical aviation). Why is this?

There are a number of things that the VKS (Russian Aerospace Force) should have done, and are paramaount to obtaining air superiority, followed by air supremacy (air superiority: dominance in the vertical - in the air - with minimal interference from the enemy, air supremacy: full dominance of the air space, null intereference from the enemy, and capability to prosecute targets with impunity), and all these are found in the air campaign during Operation desert Storm in 1991:

- SEAD (Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses): seeking and destroying fixed anti-aircraft and surface-to-air (SAM) missile emplacements, and harassing and destroying as many of the mobile SAM and gun batteries as possible - this is a very dangerous endeavour, but one that is paramount to achieving air dominance; this is done with specialized aircraft that lock on enemy radar and launch radiation-targeting missiles, also that search for enemy radar signals and direct other specialized craft to attack them. Russians don't really have much training performing SEAD, and they not only minimized its role but also considered it to be not worth pursuing it in the case of a very short conflict, as the war in Ukraine was thought to be back in February-March 2022;
- combined large formation strike packages comprising various aircraft with different roles (precision bombing, ground attack, SEAD, electronic warfare, refuelling, electronic surveillance and early warning) - this is a massive undertaking and necessitates a lot of training cross-squadrons/wings and sometimes even cross-branches (eg Air Force together with naval aviation) - the Russians are used to a more localized, highly-tactical, close to the front line, and lower altitude missions, in small numbers, lacking both coordination and specialized equipment (see lack of Precision Guided Munitions below) - even though they do possess aircraft that meet all the criteria for such large-scale missions;
- lack of PGMs (Precision Guided Munitions) - these are smart bombs and missiles, laser- or GPS-guided, that can be launched from greater distances, with much higher accuracy than dumb ammunition; the Russian VKS is suffering from accute shortages of such smart ammunition, and...
- ...above all, and probably a direct cause of the points listed above, a pronounced reluctance from the Russian command to commit significant air assets in frequent missions - it is as if they came to their senses and realized that by committing large forces they would lose a large percentage of them - this is, however, the opposite of what the Army chiefs of staff are doing, while the Air Force is preserving itself through non-committal, the Army is wasting incredibly large numbers of vehicles and men.

It seems that the current Russian Air Force commanders have studied US Air Force and US Navy's failure during Operation Rolling Thunder in Vietnam between 1965-68 - a very similar situation to the current conflict in Ukraine, whereby the US had complete numerical and technological superiority, but by not following the points above, and by using a very strict top-down command structure (all the way from the White House) and by micromanaging missions and the way they were planned, they have managed to lose a huge number of planes and men (in 1967 alone they lost in excess of 400 planes).
