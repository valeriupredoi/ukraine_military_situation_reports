Brief operational update 01 April 2022
======================================

Ukrainians continue to push back the Russ, operations that are a mix of Ukrainians pushing back and the Russ withdrawing, not necessarily forced by the Ukrainian push:

**North and North-East**

- N and NW of Kyiv a lot of the 35 and 36 Combined Arms Armies have withdrawn their badly damaged units to Belarus; the rest that is still combat-effective in various proportions are digging in and mining; the Ukrainians are expected to retake Bucha and Hostomel fully, Irpin has been under Ukrainian control for a few days now; the problem is that all these places are still very dangerous - heavily mined and boobytrapped, the Ukrainians engineers need to sweep them clean, which takes a fair bit of time;
- E and NE of Kyiv the Russ is pulling back a lot of the 2nd Guards Tank Army (90th and 4th tank divisions), and the Ukrainians are sweeping from Nizhin N of H-07 highway and pushing all the Russ in those pockets away, Sumy is getting cleared of Russ troops around it; meanwhile Kharkiv is still getting shelled, but the Ukrainians will attempt at pushing the Russ troops around it out of artillery range

**South**

The Ukrainians are currently attempting to liberate as much as possible of Kherson outskirts; Mariupol is still bitterly fought over.

**Interesting stuff**

- The Russ has accused Ukraine of attacking an oil dump inside Russia (Belogorod) with helicopetrs, provoking a large conflagration; Ukraine has very recently denied that; in fairness, why would Ukraine risk a couple of its already very precious attack helicopters to destroy an oil dump, knowing full well Russia has plenty of it?
- The promised 16,000 Assadist mercenaries from Syria materialized themselves in the form of a couple busloads (200 mercenaries, to be precise) - cold, hungry and jetlagged, probably dead too, in the next few days;
- The Russ is well and truly conducting SS-like operations in occupied territories: Rosgvardia is not only implementing military governance, but also deporting Ukrainians to Russia (sent to military bases that double up as prisoner/deportee camps)
- The Russ have withdrawn from Chernobyl, taking the 200 odd Ukranian nuclear plant staff as prisoners; the Russ idiots dug in (dug trenches) in the nuclear plant area - the soil there has a clean, radiation-free layer, on top of contaminated soil - by digging in, the Russ has exposed the contaminated soil in lots of places;
