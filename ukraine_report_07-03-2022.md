Frontlines situation 7 March 2022
=================================

**Russ Operational axes:**

- (main) Kyiv: (slow) advances from NW and E-NE
- (directly supporting) Kharkiv: stable, shelled
- (supporting) Luhansk: messy, almost to none Russ advance
- (supporting) Mariupol and the right (East) spearhead from Crimea (target: linkup with Donetsk/Luhansk):
  stable: Mariupol encircled and shelled
- (supporting) Mykolayiv and the left spearhead (West) from Crimea (target: Odessa, westward advance):
  second attempt at taking failed, Russ regrouping


**General situation:**

- currently Russ is regrouping and resupplying
- attacks in and around Irpin, in the NW of Kyiv, but not of large scale yet, and checked by the Ukrainian defenders
- yesterday Russ diverted military assets specifically to attack civilians evacuation from Irpin
- 1st and 2nd Russ Guards Tank Armies (high quality troops) slowly punching through from the E-NE of Kyiv to arrive at the out  skirts of Kyiv in the next 24-48h
- Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Sumy firmly in Ukrainian hands, but heavy Russ shelling inside the cities
- Saturday's Ukrainian counter-attack from NW Kharkiv slowed down Russ move towards the city, inflicting
  heavy losses
- Ukrainian army is now fully deployed, and conducting numerous flanking operations,
  in a a very mobile manner to avoid encirclement
- Russ CAA (Combined Arms Army) units - the largest units deployed, made up of armour,
  infantry, artillery, army aviation - trying to start coordinating attacks, rather than so far not
  being able to operate cohesiveley
- Russ Paratrooper units (elite) still being used poorly, and dropped onto hot targets, with heavy losses
- Russ is using all the forces previously deployed around Ukraine, and raising reservist units
  elsewhere in Russia, high chances of declaring martial law for mandatory conscription - these
  sort of troops will have very poor quality and morale, and will be easy prey for the Ukrainian veteran
  forces
- it is now time to evacuate as many civilians as possible from Kyiv, the city will be subject
  to horrendous bombardment within the next days
- The Russ is sending in heavy mechanized units (tanks) in around Kyiv, but these units will play
  little in an urban warfare scenario; what the Russ will probably do is they will shell Kyiv with
  static emplacement artillery
  and possibly bring in strategic bomber aircraft to drop large quantities of bombs from above
