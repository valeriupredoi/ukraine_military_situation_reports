Frontlines situation 6 March 2022
=================================

**Russ Operational axes:**

- (main) Kyiv
- (directly supporting) Kharkiv
- (supporting) Luhansk
- (supporting) Mariupol and the right (East) spearhead from Crimea (target: linkup with Donetsk/Luhansk)
- (supporting) Mykolayiv and the left spearhead (West) from Crimea (target: Odessa, westward advance)


**General situation:**

- Ukrainian marvellous resistance on all fronts;
- Russ supply lines attacked beautifully by both the Ukrainian ground forces, and by the remnants of the Ukrainian Air Force - according to the UK MoD the Russ is now concealing fuel trucks as regular general transport trucks
- Russ military has conducted very few operations in the 5-6 March period, trying to
  consolidate positions, and probaly waiting for both reinforcements and resupplies (see previous point)
- Ukrainian cities continue to be shelled by Russ artilery and bombarded by the Russ attack aircraft
- 3,000 Russ reservists are reported to have arrived in Belgorod (on the Kharkiv axis)
  (reservist units are of poor overall quality)
- the Ukrainian military has conducted a small scale, yet effective counter-attack
  near Kharkiv (direction due NW), disrupting the Russ operations that aim at enveloping and bypassing the city
- Ukrainian Air Force attacked Russ forces near Kyiv on the Sumy axis
- Russ continues to consolidate the occupation of Kherson, but probing attacks towards Mykolayiv
  have been pushed back by the Ukrainins, reporting captures of Russ armour; unclear if they will start operations towards Odessa, and if they will use amphibious units from the Black Sea (although they are assembling a flotilla of landing craft there)

**Notes on logistics:**

- poor state of Russ resupply and reinforcements; Russ needs to bring more trucks (the Convoy of Doom -
  which is currently stalled still); a good reference for the logistical situation can be found [here](https://warontherocks.com/2021/11/feeding-the-bear-a-closer-look-at-russian-army-logistics/)
- one of the main reasons why the Russ army needs so much more resupplies is the fact that they use
  a lot more artillery than NATO (about 60% more in regular operations) - artillery resupplies are bulky
  and very dangerous (one well aimed Ukrainian drone attack can create secondary explosions that can decimate
  an entire truck column - one of the reasons why you see a lot of the Russ trucks in the Convoy of Doom
  well separated from each other)

**Notes on the no-fly zone requested by the Ukrainians:**

- a no-fly zone over Ukraine is currently requested by the Ukrainians so that the Russ (mainly ground attack
  and helicopter) aircraft stop flying and attacking both military, but more pressingly, civilian targets
- a no-fly zone may not benefit the Ukrainians at this stage though - they are still conducting highly succesful aerial attacks
  with their own Air Force, and a no-fly zone would mean those will stop; also, the Russ is employing a lot more
  fixed and self-propelled artillery and cruise missiles than aircraft
- a no-fly zone will be an absolute dire need if the Russ decides to start using strategic bombers (like they did in Syria); those attacks are imprecise and devastating, and will result in horrific civilian deaths
- this is probably why the Ukrainians are also pressing for fighter aircraft to be delivered, and, converseley, why the Russ is still holding back from using a lot of their own fighters (so that they can escort the bombers)
