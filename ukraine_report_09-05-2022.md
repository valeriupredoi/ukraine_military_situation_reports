Update for 8-9 May 2022
=======================

- excellent progress from the Ukrainians outside Kharkiv, the city is almost fully outside Russ long-range artillery range, and the Ukrainians, even though temporarily checked today, will go on and push the Russ (6th CAA) to the border; possible push SE to Kupiansk, take the road node, and swing South to Izyum
- Izyum-Rubizhne/Severodoetsk-Popasna focal area: little to no progress from the Russ: Poasna fully taken but the place is like the surface of the moon (cratered by artillery) and all the town itself is comprehensevley destryed; 336 Naval Infantry (Russ Marines) stopped at the NW outskirts;
- examining the map from exactly two weeks ago (25 Apr) - minimal at best progress from the Russ - a few km here and there, while operating on frontline that is ~150km long and aiming to move 50-70km deeper overall
