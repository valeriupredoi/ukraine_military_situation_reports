The US is giving Ukraine close to $4bn in aid of which $3bn in military aid (see https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3261263/more-than-3-billion-in-additional-security-assistance-for-ukraine/ for a full list of materiel), and amongst others, 50 M2(A2 - probably ODS - "Operation Destert Storm" version from the mid-late '90s) Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicles (IFV) with 500 TOW anti-tank missiles; also, 100 M113 armoured personnel carriers (APCs); what does this mean? It means that, obviously: Ukraine needs to replenish depleted infantry units, replacing losses of Soviet/Czech/Polish BMP-2 and 3 infantry vehicles with Bradleys and M113s - but this is just the obvious reason, the actual one is related to the capability of the Bradley IFV (and, of the Marder A1 the Germans promised to deliver as well) - to fight a highly mobile, and maneouver battle, in support of a tank offensive, and part of a mobile combined arms (tanks, infantry, artillery) tactics. This, combined with the fact that the US are supplying TOW anti-tank missiles (note - not too many, 500 TOWs is about two full loads per Bradley IFV for each of the 50 ones supplied, so the Ukrainians will probably use a good part - maybe half - of their Bradleys for scout and GPS target ranging for artillery puprposes), and are pushing the Germans to give up 50 of their Marders, that have a very similar role to that of the Bradley - Ukraine is going on the offensive via armoured and mechanized fast localized attacks this spring! Where? My bets would be to retake Mariupol. Go go go!!
