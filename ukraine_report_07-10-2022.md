The Crimea bridge was attacked/sabotaged in the small hours of the morning of October 8, 2022, a day after Putin's birthday. Putin opened this bridge in 2018, with great fanfare, with the bridge symbolizing the Russian occupation of Ukrainian Crimea. The bridge is of vital role for the Russians - it is the only rail/road link between the Crimean Peninsula and the Russian mainland, and it is the longest bridge in Europe, and costing about Â£4bn - not a cheap investment! The bridge replaces the Kerch ferry link (a very inefficient and low load link), although the Russians are now using it again. Why is temporaily putting the bridge out of service important for the Ukrainian war effort? Because now, the Russians will have to use the Mariupol-Berdyansk sea route to supply their troops in and around Kherson - and, more importantly, from Berdyansk onwards to Kherson, they have to use the rail link that is now in range of Ukrainian artillery. It is, however, unclear how fast will the Russians repair the rail bridge, part of the Crimea bridge.

What happened? The Russians are saying a truck full of explosives blew up while on the bridge - this is silly - again, whoever comes up with these silly explanations needs to be fired for sabotaging Russian military PR - blast damage from a vehicle exploding would go upwards, not damage the structure under the road. In reality, it was either of these two: a missile attack from the Ukrainian side - which is pretty damn tough, given that the Ukrainian side is some 200km away - so it is possible they used an aircraft-launched missile, probably an anti-ship missile - which is a feat on its own, given how small a target a bridge is, at such a distance, or - sabotage by special forces, which again, is an incredible feat, given how well used, defended, and surveilled this prime target is. Whichever it is, hats off to the Ukrainians!
