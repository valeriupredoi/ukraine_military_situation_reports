Ukrainian forces retake Kherson, after Russian units have pulled out of the city, and crossed the Dnipro river over the Antonivskiy bridge, and other pontoon bridges, in orderly manner, but having left all their heavy gear (tanks, APCs, artillery) behind since they had to cross the river either on light bridges or in boats since ferries were shelled by the Ukrainians. Earlier today the Antonivskiy bridge (circled on map), the last major bridge still standing over the Dnipro river, has collapsed (unclear if under strain, or sabotaged by the Russ) - either way, the Ukrainians will not cross the river soon, and even when they'll do it, they will need artillery and aviation umbrella. Russian forces are now deployed on the Southern (Eastern, depending river's orientation) banks of the river, settled in exposed postions; all in all they evacuated about 15,000 troops from Kherson and another 7,000 from surrounding regions, in just a couple of days - that's two divisions evacuated in two days - impressive rush and sense of impending doom! The Ukrainian army has firm initiative, Slava Ukraini!
