Brief operational update 06 April 2022
======================================

Russ forces have completely withdrawn from around Kyiv, N and NE, and from the Sumy axis, and Chernihiv - virtually the whole of Northern Ukraine is now Russ-free (with the exception of stragglers that the Ukrainian army is currently mopping up). The Ukrainians are now hard at work restoring railway lines, and de-mining, and cleaning up; towns and villages East of Kyiv have not yet been properly cleaned up, and chances are that more Russ atrocities will be found there (just as, or even worse than in Bucha).

The Russ is now busy redeploying forces from the vacated territories to the East and South-East; their problem is that the troops that withdrew (from 35th and 36th CAA) are too damaged to be re-deployed South, so there is a lot of activity in Belogorod (Russia, close to the border) to rally, refit, and resupply all those battered troops. They have, however, redeployed troops from the Sumy axis - 1st Guards Tank Army and 2nd Motor Rifle Division, including the battered 4th Guards Tank Division - the Russ is desperate for a serious breakthrough in the East over and enveloping the Line of Contact (LOC), so...

...heavy, open-terrain, tank battles are raging in the triangle Izyum-Rubizhne-Popasna with the Russ trying to break through to Slovyansk - this is of utmost importance since if they do this, they can link up their forces from Donbass with the forces from Kharkiv-Izyum, enveloping and pinning the Ukrainians dug in around the LOC, encircle and eliminate them. The Ukrainians are not thin on troops - 92nd Mech Division, 17th Tank Division, Airborne troops - but the problem is that these guys have been fighting incessantly for 40+ days now; they really need reinforcements, and more than that, anti-tank, anti-air missiles (to shoot down Russ attack helicopters), and their own attack helicopters! The Ukrainians have waged a very effective hide in forests and hit-and-run warfare, this is completely different - large open spaces, with large units of armour (tanks) - just like in WW2 in exactly the same areas. What is encouraging so far is the Russ is still using the same poor tactics as before - sending just a few Battalion Tactical Groups (BTGs) at a time, and not attacking in force with large units.

In the South - Kherson - the Russ is showing fierce resistance - their front around herson is weak but they are fiercely contesting the Ukrainian advance; proves out Zusko is still in command (he's never actually reliquished the command) so that's not good news for the Ukrainians - Zusko is the only actually capable commanding officer of a Combined Army. The good news for the Ukrainians is that it appears that all the Russ' naval infantry units (marines) - as in - all from all over Russia - have been committed in the war so far, and suffered badly around Kyiv, and in Mariupol, so an amphibious assault on Odessa is 99% not going to happen.
