Brief update on Russ command and control - Frankendivisions and high losses
===========================================================================

The former Red Army (Soviet Army after 1945) is known for its 1942-onwards massive attacks of combined arms (infantry, tanks, artillery and army aviation) - large units (tank armies) measuring tens of thousands moving at once, directed towards a single target. The other characteristic of the Red/Soviet Army was the utter disregard for losses (both human and materiel), since resources towards the latter stages of WW2 were so large they could afford huge losses. Example related to the current setting in Ukraine: the Dnipr-Carpathian offensive resulted in the deployment of 2.4 million Soviet troops moving together in three-four tank armies, and in the 4-5 months while the offensive lasted, losing 1.1 million in casulaties (dead, wounded, prisoners etc) - the offensive was a decisive Soviet victory, but at a huge cost.

Coming back to the current situation in Ukraine - the Russ has had large losses in the first 6 weeks of war - Battalion Tactical Groups from the North suffered the most; these are currently regrouping in the Belogorod area in Russia, but there is little chance they will form fully functional units in useful time. Instead, what the Russ is doing - and has so far - they are patching different units with elements of other units, creating almost fully operational units on paper, but Frankenunits in actuality. This is the same way they attack as well - they send in elements of units (fractions of Divisions) rather than the whole thing - this is bad both at the point of assembly (since a unit that has just been formed is much leass combat-effective than a unit that has been together for a long time), and at the point of deployment since small attacks are of course more easily repelled, than a full force attack with large combined arms units working together.

This is what the recent reshuffling of the Russ command is trying to achieve - cohesion and coordination. Cohesion - assemble larger combat units comprised of troops that are drawn from the same unit, or, at least, from units that trained together, and coordination - act as one towards a single target, and not scatter small-scale attacks all over the place. Gen. Dvonikov, as the single arch-commander of the Russ forces in Ukraine, is assigned this difficult task.

ISW writes: "This simplification of the Russian command structure may not resolve all of Russia’s command problems, however. Most of the reinforcements flowing into the Donbas region are drawn from other military districts, for one thing. The active Russian offensive drive from Izyum to the southeast relies on the concentration of Russian forces around Kharkiv that draws in turn on the logistics hub of Belgorod in Russia—both in areas nominally under Zhuravlyov’s control. Russian forces will likely continue to struggle to establish coherent and efficient command and control arrangements for the foreseeable future."

High losses and morale problems are dire, but, as we know from previous operations of the Soviet and Russian army, these are not something the generals care much for. This leads to constant patching behind the lines, and to increased brutality on the actual front lines (the use of heavy artillery and air strikes to stall counter-attacks until the unit is combat-effective again, at least numerically). Only in the direst of dire cases does the unit get withdrawn (goes to show how badly damaged the units around Kyiv and on the Sumy axis were, that they were actually withdrawn).

As an example of already flawed approach (in essence, a continuation of the previous approach of piecemeal deployment of mixed (Franken)units) - the 18th Guards Motor Rifle Division deployed to Donbass, and pictured by the Maxar satellite yesterday (8-9 April) - the convoy is 12km long which suggests this is just the spearhead of the entire Division, and probably just this element will be thrown in for now (a lot of Grad, and regular, and self-propelled artillery, suggesting they will pound the Ukranian lines for a few days before starting to advance).
