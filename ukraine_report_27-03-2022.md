Brief operational update 27 March 2022
======================================

It appears that, despite continual attempts to reinforce the Kyiv effort (with lower grade reinforcements), the Russ has more or less abandoned offensive operations both in the West and East of the city, with the Eastern arm (1st and 2nd Guards Tank Armies) in either full retreat or in a very bad situation (reports of the Russ garrison being encircled at Hostomel, Irpin being almost fully liberated, Brovary and Lukyanivka in the East, liberated) - effort seems to be shifting towards East now:

NE/East: Russ capture the town of Slavutych, near Chernihiv (which should have been under their occupation long ago), but Ukrainian 92rd Mechanized Division is in full advance from West to East in the rears of what used to be 2nd Guards Tank Army (Guards Combined Arms Army) on the line between Nizhin and Sumy - it appears the Russ 2nd GCAA is in full retreat, or, to the very least, abandoning advanced positions - reports of very low morale among Russ Guards troops, at least one report about the 4th Guards Tank Division (Kantemirovskaya) commander Zhuravlyov committing suicide, other commander being run over by his own men with a tank; 

Ukrainian 93rd Mechanized Division swinging towards Izyum, after a successful counter-attack in the region of Kharkiv, Izyum is where the Russ 6th and 8th CAA are now converging, and it remains a focal point and this town will decide the fate of the Ukrainian positions on the Line of Contact (LOC) in the Donetsk/Luhansk regions.

Mariupol is still holding, and judging by the pre-war estimates, its garrison of about 7,000 strong, is well supplied and may hold out longer than a lot of analysts are saying. Russ air and artillery attacks are mainly directed against civilian targets, and are not contribution much towards degrading the Ukrainian garrison; having said that, the remainder of some 100,000 civilians left in the city are experiencing purgatory.

Kherson is a ticking bomb for the Russ - there appears to be no actual front line, the Ukrainian military has now advanced in the outer suburbs, and, from inside the city, the Rosgvardia is having a very hard time keeping protesters under control; by the looks of it, the city is nearing an armed rebellion from its occupied residents, and hopefully that will coincide with a push from the Ukrainian army.
