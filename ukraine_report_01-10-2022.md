While Putin is signing stuff on toilet paper and assemblying workers and students to wave flags (those that are themselves crapping their pants they might get sent to the front - and rightly so!), the Ukrainian army has fully encircled Lyman, the first large scale encirclement of the Russian/Soviet/Red Army since WW2. Multiple units trapped into a small perimeter, numbers vary from 2,000 to 5,000 Russian military, cut off fully. They now depend on two things - how much good will are the Ukrainians willing to show (and I wouldn't bet my dinner on that), and how much does Putin care for them, and again, my dinner stays with me. Given Putin's 'no step back' order, I presume no official surrender will be called for, but rather, they'll just call it quits, probably they're already doing that.
