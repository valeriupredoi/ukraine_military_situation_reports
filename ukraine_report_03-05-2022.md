Brief update for 1-2 May 2022
=============================

- Russ have not conducted any major assaults or operations across Ukraine; it seems that the artillery attack reported by Ukrainians to have destroyed a command post (with heavy Russ losses of high ranking officers) South of Izyum from two days ago did indeed disrupt whatever the Russ was up to there
- As a result of the smashing of the ELINT (electronic warfare and jamming) station on Snake Island by Ukrainians a few days ago, the Russ was now sending Raptor-class fast patrol boats to the island, only that the Ukrainians had different ideas, so they blew to the skies two of them (image attached, using Bayraktar drones)
- The Russ is reported to have "borrowed" some of the Ukrainians' excellent tactical mobile operations - in small numbers attacking at different points of a target, only to vanish as quickly as they appeared - but the Russ forgot to vanish, so the Ukrainians ambushed and destroyed a squad of the 24th Spetsnatz Brigade (to the last man);
- The only troops left in Mariupol appear to be DNR (separatists), and oddly enough, the ones that left to reinforce other units went to the Izyum-Popasna-Rubizhne triangle, clearly still considered the centre of mass
- Kremlin is planning to fully annex Donetsk, Luhansk, and Kherson Oblast into Russia, preparing dummy referenda in these regions; not sure how the separatists will receive this, after getting the very short end of the stick being used as cannon fodder, and Ukrainian artillery targets
