Brief updates for 6-7 May 2022
==============================

- the Ukrainian counter-offesnive North and East, South-East of Kharkiv is gaining momentum; it is by now a "counter-offensive" rather than a group of counter-attacks, and is developing into a nasty problem for the Russ - indeed the 4-5 battalion tactical groups the Russ had in the area have started to withdraw at speed, and the Ukrainians will probably free the whole area around Kharkiv to the Russ border in the next days; reports say that what they find is utter devastation: the Russ have destroyed all farms and settlements, looted and burnt what they could find;
- the Ukrainians may be able to develop the counter-offensive towards Kupiansk then on to the South towards Izyum; Kupiansk is a road node and they could take the highway due South, giving the Russ a beating in their rear of their Izyum line
- the Russ have been active around Severodonetsk, aiming to reach Lychichiansk, but not much progress was made in the last 24-48 hours; it seems that there is the only place they can concentrate some force put pressure on the Ukrainians defending on the Eastern bank of the Siever-Donetsk river; the fact that the Ukrainians are committing sizeable forces for the counter-offensive around Kharkiv shows that they probably have this development more to the South under control
- the Ukrainian Air Force (fully destroyed at the beginning of March, as the Russ was boasting) is back to more numerous operations, flying about 10 sorties daily in the East; not destroyed, not even remotely
- the Russ on Zminiy Island (Snake Island, Romanian - Insula Serpilor, off the coast of Romania and Ukraine) is under siege from the air - the Ukrainians have destroyed their electronic warfare facilities back a few days ago, and now they are using drones to interdict any supplies reaching the by patrol boat, and...
- it appreas that Russ Navy's Grigorovich-class frigate Admiral Makarov was attacked yetrday with Neptune anti-ship missiles, and allegedly caught fire; fate is unknown at the moment - the attack was not confirmed by neither Ukranians, nor Russ, nor Americans; this ship is the juciest target in the Black Sea after the sinking of the Moskva, it's a very modern ship (commissioned end of 2017) and how wonderful would be if it also got sunk!
