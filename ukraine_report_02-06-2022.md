Ukraine short update - this time no maps, but a German IRIS-T SL surface to air missile system (SAM), that the German Chancellor Scholz touted it will be given to Ukraine. Manufactured by Diehl AG, it was a result of a failed European collaborative effort to build the next generation air-to-air missile (to replace the Sidewinder) - the project failed, but the missile prototype was almost there, so it was further developed into a variety of missiles in Germany, UK, France etc - the Germans eventually converting it into a surface-to-air system too, and a very powerful one. But here's the thing - Diehl makes about 4 (four) complete systems per year - and this year three of them are earmarked for Egypt. Good thing the US promised Egypt the world and stars (ie bribed a whole lot of top brass) if they can wait for the delivery for next year, rerouting those IRIS's meant for Egypt to Ukraine. The US has finally approved the HIMARS very long range multiple rocket artllery systems for Ukraine, so it looks like Ukraine will be armed to the teeth by end July/start August. That's about the time when I suspect they will start delivering a great deal of whoopass to the Russ - not that they're not doing it right now, actually - Popasna is being cut to sherds by the Ukrainian counter-attack - the Russ is forced to divert key forces to halt their already damaged lines. The Ukr are performing a textbook retreat from Severodonetsk - slow, methodical, and with solid rearguard - they vacated about 80% of the city by now, going towards Lysychansk, probably vacating that too, just to keep a solid contact line on the Izyum-Slovyansk-Kramatorsk-Bakhmut-Popasna line, and grind the Russ to a halt there, then start the counter-offensive - stuff that Rommel himself would have probably done! Oh and keep an eye on the Ukr counter-attacks in Kherson Oblast - things are getting juicy there, it is possible this time round the Ukrainians take back Kherson - Russ is panicked enough to send their Wagner Paramil pack of criminals - they are now using them as shock troops, because they've lost so many actual elite units.
