For all intents and purposes the Russ offensive in the East (Izyum-Popasna-Rubizhme triangle, push to Severodonetsk, push to Barvinkove and Sloviansk, South of the LOC, and all the way to Mykolaiv and Zaporizhyia) is STALLED like a Monday morning. The Ukrainians are doing a great job NW and SE of Kharkiv and have now pushed the Russ more than 40km on all sides of the city; the Russ has stopped shelling the city - one, because, they can barely reach it, and two - because they finally realized it's more important to shell Ukrainian positions than their civilians - this (counter-offensive) will probably drain even more of the already battered BTGs from around Izyum. 49 and 58 CAA in the South ie poised to attack towards Mykolaiv and Krivyi Rih have stalled too, they simply don't have enough troops to do much harm, even if Mariupol is now garrisoned only by the DNR and some rando Chechens (that "stormed" the Azovstal works yesterday, only to be pushed out today). This said, here is a timeline I wrote comparing the Russ operations around Kyiv and on the Sumy axis with the operations in the East - the Russ proves to be as on time reaching stalling, and probably failing (in the East) as a German train - or, Ukrainian train, bringing NATO weapons to the frontline (yes, the Russ has tried to bomb the electrical powerplants of the Ukrainian railways, but their trains are mostly diesel, so they're still bang on time).
