Biden just announced the decision to deliver Ukraine 31 M1 Abrams main battle tanks; these will come with eight M88 recovery vehicles, at a total package cost of $400M - no list of hardware that I could find, just yet, but judging from the price tag, and the fact that these are commercially-delivered vehicles through what a friend said it's definitely not CIA fronts, they could be upgraded M1A1 (SA) or possibly even M1A2 SEP or SEPv2 - these are names for different upgrades from the base model, most importantly armour and optics/electronics. The fact that these tanks are not delivered straight from US military reserve stocks suggests it'll take a while for them to arrive in Ukraine, possible a few months. In the meantime Ukraine is getting a proverbial mixed bag of other vehicles: 14 Challenger 2 tanks from the UK, 14 Leopard 2A4 from Germany, 14 Leopard 2PL (a modernized 2A4) from Poland, about 100 M2 Bradley infantry fighting vehicles, 20 (I think) M1128 Stryker 105mm self propelled artillery systems, these from the US, 50 CV90 IFVs from Sweden, a number of AMX10RC self-propelled guns from France, Netherlands is also sending some 90 refurbished T-72 tanks - and the list will continue. How they're gonna arrange logistics for all these is beyond me, it looks like a nightmare just listing these few main types, let alone listing the types of ammunition they need, and other things like spare parts, electronics, radios etc - the good thing is all are at NATO standards so there is some degree of standardization in the way they are operated. At any rate, Russia mumbled something along the lines of "they'll burn like other Ukrainian tanks" in response to Biden's announcement, and that's about it. I am personally looking to buy some popcorn and watch how the Russ tanks start getting knocked-out like pins at a bowling alley when the Leos, Challys, and Abramses have arrived and got deployed.
