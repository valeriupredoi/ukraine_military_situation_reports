A few thoughts about the "surprise" referenda that will allow Putin to annex Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson Oblasts, parts of Zaporizshiya, and the bridge between Donetsk and Crimea (inc. Mariupol). TL;DR: don't thinks of this more than a warcry from a sloth.

Russia announces referenda in Luhanks and Donetsk with the obvious result that those provinces be annexed to Russia as Russian land; this is hasty panicky effort to feed something to the Russian public, even if it is a massive lie. Political arguments aside, the military situation is completely against such stupidity:

- Russia/Putin will hope to declare some sort of victory by annexing these territories: it is not seeing that parts of these territories are controlled by Ukraine, with an ever increasing proportion being taken back by Ukraine through their ongoing counter-offensive; it is as if Germany had occupied the Vichy France in 1944 instead of 1943 - they did it in 1943 exactly to prevent a change of sides to Allies of the French collaborationist government, and also to shore up defences when the Allies would eventually land (Normandy and the South coast) - there'd been no point for Germany to "annex" Vichy France when the Allies were already controlling large parts of it;
- Putin hopes to scare the Ukrainians from conducting attacks in what will be Russia in a week - this is also silly since the Ukrainians have performed numerous operations in Crimea and even Russia, and bombed the crap out of their ammo depots in Crimaea as of lately;
- Putin "thinks" the West will be scared to push on with training and weapons deliveries - slim chances since the Ukrainians are already undergoing advanced training on numerous weapons systems that will enter their service very soon; also, Western intelligence has predicted such a move - it is a textbook move from a totalitarian regime;
- Putin "hopes" attacks (counter-offensive operations) on what will be Russia will make the Russian people rise to arms, and a general mobilization will then be received much better than now, when a lot of the Russian people have lost appetite for the "special military operation" - he thinks he could then call it a Patriotic War, and call up millions of reservists; this is tricky - since he's perfectly capable to do that (ie no resistance from any politician in Moscow) - but that will amount to nothing in the short run, while the Ukrainians could re-take most of Luhansk and Donetsk, and to a disaster and crushing defeat of that massive reservist army, that, with very poor equipment, training, and supplies, will have to go on the counter-attack, facing a modern, much better equipped and supplied, Ukrainian army, that, by then, will have a heapload of Western modern weapons, and solid training operating them. Putin knows he will lose;
- So, in essence, this is just another soap bubble, nothing that can change anything substantially in the way Russia is losing the War in Ukraine, and nothing that can change anything in the way NATO is handling the situation too.
