Tactical update for the Russian Offesnive in East Ukraine 20-21 April 2022
==========================================================================

The Russ offensive in East Ukraine has started 3-4 days ago, initially with large scale artillery and air attacks, then, gradually with troop movements. The offensive is not as large-scale or as coherent as it ought to be given the objective: Russ attacks on the ground are performed in a very predictable manner, and the amount of kinetic force, given the front they are attacking is huge (300-400 km) is limited since the Russ does not have the numbers for a stronger kinetic force. They are, however, still grouping in bases in Russia, for what appears to be an increase in numerical strength. However, even an increased numerical strength will probably not achieve a major breakthrough, given the Russ is still lacking coordination between arms, and their attacks are still suffering from correct positioning with flanks and rears protected while the main thrust is advancing. In terms of actual numbers of troops, the Russ is now starting to conscript Ukrainians (yes, Ukrainians!) from the occupied territories - a move that will most definitely not go down well - there is already a lot of partosan activity there, and this will only intensify these sabotage and resistance actions. The idiot in Kremlin is running out of certain ammunition too (mostly ballistic and cruise missiles, for which he had to activate mothballed systems like Tochka, and use anti-ship missiles for attacking targets on land), and the Russ industry is now suffering from shortages of key components (chips and electronic parts) - but, not to be confused with the concept that the Russ is running out of hardware - they still have plenty of artillery ammunition, tanks (albeit a lot of them are unmodernized T-72 and T-80), it's the men that are the problem - so expect that there will be a general mobilization in Russia soon.

A bit about the Ukrainians receiving military gear from the West: on 6 April the US Congress has unanimously passed the Lend Lease Act (exactly like the one passed in 1941 to supply weapons to Britain and USSR), and this Act has to phases: an initial, immediate phase during which heavy weaponry gets sent to Ukraine (and we are talking actual heavy stuff: Soviet-made tanks from NATO storage, artillery - M777 155mm howitzers, ammunition for the Ukrainian Soviet-made 122mm and 152mm field artillery, M113 armoured personnel carriers, M142 HIMARS multiple rocket launcher systems, MRAP vehicles, helicopters etc.), and a second, longer-term phase (6 months to 1 year) where Ukrainian personnel is trained on US and NATO-standard systems (M1 Abrams, F-16 fighters) so that they can be delivered to and operated by the Ukrainians - if the Ukrainians can hold on until this second phase finishes and the Russ doesn't call it quits by then, then the Russ will have a nasty surprise of Abrams tanks obliterating their rusty T-72s and Apache helicopers piloted by Ukranians pulverizing their mobile artillery. The first phase of mostly Soviet-era weapons delivery is ongoing (and don't listen to the media saying Germany and others are dragging their feet - they are shifting a lot of equipment exactly as I'm writing this, a lot is done in secret for obvious reasons, though). These deliveries are done through Poland and Romania and the logistics is incredible - the Russ is saying it's attacking these lines, but the truth is they simply have no idea where these convoys are, so they attack mostly what they think are depots and storage facilities, with mediocre success too.

Briefly abot the current offensive: the Russ has been pushing with little success and no major breakthroughs, but on a very large front so they are keeping the Ukrainian defenders busy everywhere - they have managed to take a couple settlements (on the Izyum axis they took Kreminna, and are pushing through Rubizhne and Popasna at the moment, unverified reports that Rubizhne is under Russ control); the Ukrainians are conducting very precise artillery attacks, and, in places, adopt the "trade space for time" tactic, retreating to organize a better resistance and counter-attacks. As such, a swift Ukrainian counter-attack south of Izyum nearly wiped out Dvornikov's command centre, and only after heavy losses did they stop the Ukrainians, one BTG having had to be retreated to Russia after it got decimated. The Russ are attacking in a very predictable manner, and the Ukrainians can organize defenses; the land is still filled with mud, so the movement is limited mostly to roads still (at least logistics movement by trucks is only on roads).  It is very possible that the only thing that Putin will have to pride himself with at the 9 May Parade will be the fall of Mariupol - even though even that one might be a close cut by 9 May, with the Ukrainian 36th Marines and Azov still inside the Azovstal steelworks, with the latest from Moscow, an order to seal them off there, probably to be pounded with even more heavy ammunition (yes, the guys there were blasted in the past days with heavy bombs dropped by Tu-22M bombers). The number of Ukrainians defenders there vary wildly from about 500 to 2500, so nothing is certain yet.
