Tactical update for the Russian Offesnive in East Ukraine 20-21 April 2022
==========================================================================

The Russ offensive in East Ukraine has started 3-4 days ago, initially with large scale artillery and air attacks, then, gradually with troop movements. The offensive is not as large-scale or as coherent as it ought to be given the objective: Russ attacks on the ground are performed in a very predictable manner, and the amount of kinetic force, given the front they are attacking is huge (300-400 km) is limited since the Russ does not have the numbers for a stronger kinetic force. They are, however, still grouping in bases in Russia, for what appears to be an increase in numerical strength. However, even an increased numerical strength will probably not achieve a major breakthrough, given the Russ is still lacking coordination between arms, and their attacks are still suffering from correct positioning with flanks and rears protected while the main thrust is advancing.
