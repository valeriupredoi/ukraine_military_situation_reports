Ukraine short update for June 4th 2022 (100th day of Russia's invasion): Ukrainians have conducted a successful counter-attack in Severodonetsk, after retreating in order for the past few days; in the process they pushed the Russ in the South-East of the city, retaking the wooded areas east of the city; this was a standard 'trade space for time' operation from the Ukrainians, and they regrouped to hit back at the Russ (with reported very heavy Russ casulaties). Lysychansk it is used as artillery platform by the Ukrainians, who say they have evacuated most all civilians from Severodonetsk, hence now freely pounding the Russ in there, from the elevated position of Lysychansk. T1302 main supply route, and secondary roads are still open for Ukr resupply traffic too. The Russ is concentrating a lot of men and gear in Severodonetsk and not only risks heavy losses (which are happening) but also thinned down forces elsewhere to allow for such concentration: 35 CAA in Izyum is so depleted that even if they tried to advance due Slovyansk, to link up with the prong from Lyman, they not only got stopped but are in a very real risk of being completely overrun by the Ukrainians (93rd Mechanized Brigade), including their Headquarters. Elsewhere, the Russ push from Lyman due direction Slovyansk was stopped too. Popasna: the Russ is getting in all sorts of deadly troubles there - of note is the decimation of the 64th Independent Motor Rifle brigade, believed to be partly responsible for the atrocities in Bucha, earlier in the war. And, before I finish, I wanted to point out at something many of you might have seen and wondered what the heck is it - that, in the second picture, is an example of ass pillow - a very practical piece of foam that soldiers carry with them so they don't sit directly on cold and wet armoured vehicles, or in the dirt in trenches. Apparently you can get them on eBay :D
